<p>I've had the privilege of meeting incredible personalities from all walks of life; working within different professions with unique goals and personal values. However, one thing they do have in common, is the fact that they had inspired me to be a better version of myself; to push towards my own goals and to see my own values in a different perspective. These are the stories of those people.</p>

<div class="card-container">
  {% for profiles in site.data.inmyshoes %}
    {% for person in profiles.people %}
      <div class="card">
        <h2 class="blogName">{{ person.name }}</h2>
          <a href="profiles/{{ person.name}}.html">
            <img class="blogImage" src="{{ profiles.imagefolder }}/{{ person.filename }}">
          </a>
        <div class="stats">
          <p>Occupation: {{ person.occupation }}</p>
          <p>{{ person.factCategory }}: {{ person.factFact }} </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    {% endfor %}
  {% endfor %}
