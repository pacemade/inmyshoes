<h1 class="to-fade-up">Okay...</h1>

I was born in Hong Kong and I immigrated here when I was a kid. Moved back to Hong Kong to do some grade school and then finished high school/university in Toronto. These days I'm working as an illustrator/animator; I do motion graphics and stuff like that at a production company in Toronto. I’ve done other jobs before, but I kind of... arrived here? After just working a bunch and realizing what I actually wanted to do. So that took me a while, but yeah... that’s where I’m at now.

<h3 class="question">Being an illustrator/animator, what are some problems that you run into that you think others might not experience?</h3>

Yeah... I think that nobody goes into this kind of field of work thinking, “I don’t love it, I’m just doing it for the money”, cause: A, Where the money at? Because I haven't seen it yet. B, because it’s actually quite closely related to your own personal... I guess... it’s internally rewarding, right? Nobody draws art because someone told them to or something. There’s a lot of times you get into situations where there’s no distinction between your professional life and your personal life; you always feel like the last thing you did is the best representation of yourself. So if things go wrong (and sometimes it’s beyond your control, especially if you’re working on a project with multiple parts with multiple parties), you have to learn how to make that distinction as to not let it affect you in terms of your own self identity and your own self-esteem. So that’s something I think I struggle with... especially in the early stages.

<h3 class="question">How did you manage to get out of that?</h3>

WHO SAYS I'M OUT OF IT? <i>(laughs)</i> Well... yeah, so I think... the thing is I’m still refining what it is that I really wanna do. Even within the field, there are a lot of things that you can specialize in—whatever you want to devote your energy towards, right? Cause it's like... YOUR portfolio, YOUR work that you wanna make. After reaching 2 years at this job, you start to understand aspects about yourself that are not just on a technical level in terms of the work that you do, but also yourself as a person. And you have to understand that your strengths are your strengths, obviously... but you’re just as defined by your weaknesses. So just paying attention to that, not getting too worked up over it, but learning how to leverage it to just be.... yourself. It’s something that I’m trying to pay attention towards, and also just limiting myself in terms of all of the different things I could do.

<h3 class="question">Given the choice of anybody in the world, dead or alive, who would you invite to a dinner party?</h3>

I don't even really know.. I don't have any uh... heroes or anything... I guess... <i>(thinks intensely)</i>... I mean it’s moreso I’m drawing a blank, but... you know the game Katamari Damacy? The guy who created the game, he’s someone who I think is a really cool person. I really like his video games: they're really interesting and really out of the box. They’re casual games, but even though I say casual, it’s not really a derogatory thing? With Katamari Damacy, I feel like even people who weren’t particularly interested in games (or at least what they thought games were), were able to get into it. He’s gone to do more stuff these days and he’s just got this really interesting outlook on things. I see his Twitter post and he’s just... he’s always just making funny, weird observations about things. He didn’t have a video game background either, but I think because of that, you’re more free from certain preconceptions. At the end of the day, something like a game is such a huge group effort. Just kind of... just being curious about the whole process of working with people to make something like this happen would be really interesting to find out.

<h3 class="question">Would you like to be famous, in so in what way, if not, why?</h3>

Uhmm... would I like to be famous? I guess it depends for what <i>(laughs)</i>, you know? You don’t want to be that person that like... shot an elephant or something, and then has their photos of animal hunting on Facebook. But I think it would be a lie for anyone to say that they don't want to be famous. So fame is... extreme external validation, and I think everyone wants that. So to answer your question... sure. If somebody was like, “You’re gonna be famous for being like, cool” then yeah. Though I guess I still am not comfortable with that to a certain degree because there are people actually that... One of my family members told me that they wanted to be Instagram famous, and they ended up doing it—they were really deliberate with their social media. I'm sure the job that they have now has to do with the fact that they worked hard at being a... what is now known as a <i>(air quotes)</i> “Social influencer”. I mean it’s tiring because you’re constantly feeling like you’re performing in front of an audience, right? Even if it’s just photos, you’re constantly thinking of making sure people are still interested in you. If you’re a movie star, or an artist, you could make music, you could do movies, at least you have an agent and PR people to handle that for you. If you're hyper-aware of that, and constantly kind of objectifying yourself, you’re not really inhabiting your own life anymore, right?  I dunno... it's a double-edged sword basically is what I’m saying.

<h3 class="question">So anything in particularly you would like to be famous for?</h3>

Probably illustration/animation so I can get MORE WORK <i>(laughs)</i>.

<h3 class="question">What would constitute a perfect day for you? The moment you wake up to when you go to sleep?</h3>

I wake up annnd... I’m HYDRATED, my hair is PERFECT and my room is CLEAN. I get up... I have a nice, slow breakfast—most of the time I’m rushing. Around mid-day I’d be sooo, "Do whatever I feel like doing" and then I don't know... just decide what I wanna do during that entire day, and then I go to bed whenever I want to go to bed. Kind of like... a free day would be a perfect day, that’s what I’m about; chill day, no pre-made appointments where I can just play it by ear.

<h3 class="question">When was the last time you sang to yourself? To someone else?</h3>

Myself... I don't know actually... a week ago, two weeks ago? I mean if you’re like humming a song, or like singing along to some song that you’re listening to, I would say maybe two weeks ago? I’ve no idea what song it would’ve been. Last time I sang to someone... <i>(thinks intensely)</i>... I think to a cat? We have a cat does that count?

<h3 class="question">For what in life are you most grateful for?</h3>

I think... I mean the very basic go-to would be that Im grateful to be alive? I'm ALIVE, but also I’m living in this: top, elite, social-economic tier, within like.... the PLANET, okay? I’m not Warren Buffet, but there’s a lot of things that I don't have to worry about, and I can think about stuff like, “Self-fulfillment”, which is a luxury to have as a thing that stresses me out. Yeah, there’s a lot of things that I don't even know I’m taking for granted. So to all the things that I don't even know I have to think about, I’m grateful for. Like I have free time, that’s... some people don't have free time in this world.

<h3 class="question">If you could change anything in how you were raised or how you grew up, what would you change?</h3>

What would I change? I’ve thought about this before and... there are things that I draw direct connections between the person that I am now, and my childhood growing up—I think the things that are frustrating me now about myself are the things that I would change... but there’s also two sides to it. For example: I think I’m fairly... this is weird to be talking about myself in this way, but I think I’m fairly self-sufficient, fairly independent. I think part of it comes from growing up with parents that are more... you feel sad about something, or frustrated or whatever... it’s like being sad about it isn't going to make things better, so you gotta figure it out yourself. I just felt I should take care of it myself. When I was growing up I was definitely a people pleaser; it just kind of developed to a point where... NOW I started to realize that I don’t ask for help enough. I didn't really get it until very recently, even at work my boss has told me, “Hey if you need something, just let me know, we’re a team!” But I didn’t really actually take that seriously cause I was thinking, “Yeah, okay, great... this is just lip-service. I still gotta carry this project to the finish line.” So I'm kind of trying to be more mindful of that recently because I do that with work, I do that with my own personal life.  There are very few people that I feel totally okay with in terms of telling them that I’m really not okay or struggling with something. Because a lot of time when I do that with anyone, it makes me really kind of like... hate myself afterwards? And so usually it’s people who kind of already, “Get it” in terms of this feeling where you need to take care of your own shit all the time—even if you’re just imagining it. So I’m trying to really work on that this coming year.

<h3 class="question">Are there any steps that you’re working on right now to allow that change?</h3>

I think... first of all accepting that this is who I am? There’s a high likelihood that it’s not gonna change, so that’s step one. Step two is just being more mindful of the kind of tendencies that I have when I’m stressed. So one thing I would change... I think if I didn't feel like I constantly needed to please expectations that were real/imagined from my parents—that would probably lower a lot of stress that I had as a kid. Just being mindful in how I’m reacting to it, cause I was... I still AM stressed about work, life, and having to do a bunch of stuff. My reaction is: I just don't want people... I need people to leave me alone. This kind of goes back to my people pleasing tendencies where I feel like, “Oh okay I need to respond to that Facebook invite right away, I need to respond to this person’s text. Okay I’m working with someone and I need to make sure that because they’re new, I need be there for this person, if my boss doesn't understand the thing that I’m pitching him it’s my job to help him understand.” Things like that, right? I feel responsible for a lot of things, I feel like I need to just do it right... I’m supposed to. You’re functioning and dealing with it, and sometimes or people people pile it on, or they don’t see that you’re actually a hot mess, but you’re just kind of delivering still. I get to a certain point where I get really, “Nobody talk to me, just leave me alone.” I need to kind of learn how to be more... anticipate when I’m actually going to be, “This is too much” because I actually don’t know.

<h3 class="question">If you could wake up and gain any ability or character trait, what would it be and why?</h3>

Probably to be able to find anything. As you can see I’ve given this a lot of thought because I gave you an answer right away <i>(cheeky smile)</i>. I lose things... I lost my Presto card maybe three times and I just really hate it when I lose stuff; it just seems to happen. If I could just have the ability to like.. anything I need to find... I could find it! It’d be great. Also really would be great as a side hustle: some sort of like P.I. type situation, like I can look for stuff and investigate the things. Just a useful skill i think.

<h3 class="question">If a crystal ball could tell you the truth about yourself, your life, the future or anything else, what would you want to know?</h3>

The truth. When I... when I’m gonna die. If I know exactly when I’m gonna die, then I’m gonna make the most meaningful use of my time. It’s like if I know I’m gonna die in 10 years, I’m gonna make sure these 10 years are going to be as meaningful as I can make it.

<h3 class="question">Is there something that you dreamed of doing for a long time? Why haven't you done it?</h3>

<div class="quote to-fade-up">
  <h2>"{{ page.quote1 }}"</h2>
</div>

I graduated out of my first degree program where I was doing something else (art history), I wasn't doing this. I knew I liked art, but I was too chicken-shit to actually be like, “I'm going to do art,” so I studied art history instead. I told my parents, “Yeah, I'll do this degree, and then I'll apply to law school.” Looking back it sounds like I’m really insane, but I mean when you’re 17, you don’t really know anything—you don’t have ANY life experience. I felt like I had a sheltered upbringing... that stuff, in terms of what I wanted to do, I figured it out by doing a bunch of shit I didn't want to do. Now I think about it more it’s more like... I would like to work and life in a different country by myself.  That’d be really interesting, it’d be an interesting challenge.

<h3 class="question">Anywhere in particular?</h3>

I actually really enjoy the time I spent in Melbourne, in Australia; it’s frickin beautiful there, it's REALLY beautiful there. And the city, it’s actually quite similar to... it’s different, but also similar enough to a Canadian city—very multi-cultural, at least in Melbourne anyway. Obviously other parts, not so much maybe? It’s really great, there's a really great art scene there, but I really like how the fact that it’s out on its... little continent. Otherwise, a feasible one that’s really easy to maintain, really easy to do... maybe Montreal? Something a little more ambitious, maybe somewhere in Europe like Berlin, or the Netherlands.

<h3 class="question">What does friendship mean to you? Can you describe a best friend?</h3>

I think a best friend is someone who... that’s hard to say... I think a friend is someone who actually cares, and who kind of understands you in a certain way. I guess a really good friend, or a best friend, is someone who will... think about your well-being when you’re not. Be willing to get into conflict... for your sake, get into an argument because that shows they care about you. They care enough about you to get into a fight with you. I think that later in life, it’s a lot easier to for people to be like ,“Okay” and then not say anything. You’re kind of putting yourself out there by arguing with someone or doing something you think would be annoying to them. So I think a best friend is someone that would actually reach out all the way for you.

Somebody that will... someone that makes me feel that I’m perfectly fine as of right now. Like there’s nothing that I really need to change about myself in any way. I don't need them to agree with anything I say for them to open up to me. I think also... this would be nice to have, but basically I think I have some friends that understand my compulsions enough that they can tell when I'm under a lot of stress—even when I’m not aware that I’m under a lot of stress. They will come and take care of me. They’ll be pro-active about it, because I don't really... I don't really, “Do that.” The most I'll do is go on a rant like, “Wow people are garbage,” and then you know... and then just like, “I just need to be alone right now.”

I have a friend who invited me over to just stay at her place, we played video games all day all night, and then the next day, somebody else was coming over to make lunch. And she invited me to stay still, and have lunch. That meant a lot to me, for someone to just kind of... let me relax and just be a person bumming off your food, stuff like that, that enjoys just my company. That really meant a lot to me, cause I don't think I’ve ever felt like someone else was taking care of my shit for me... very often.

<h3 class="question">For you, what is your greatest achievement in your life so far?</h3>

That I haven’t given up yet. I think that’s my achievement so far—that I haven't given up. I’ve grown up with friends and peers who went to the same high school, went to college, started working and... we get together every so often, and there’s people that I’ve talked to that have said that they wished they could leave what they were doing and try something else. It’s really hard when you’re kind of comfortable enough to not make that change. And so I think I’ve done that before in the past, in my 20’s and stuff; I was trying to figure out... well it's not even figure out, but come to terms that I actually wanted to become an artist, and to just arrive at that conclusion and actually do something about it, because you could arrive at that conclusion and NOT do something about it. At this point in my life, I’m... I know what I want, but now I just need to work really hard to get it, and  continue to figure out more questions, like I’m not gonna stop now. So it’s like that, that I haven't given up.

<h3 class="question">What is your most treasured memory?</h3>

<div class="quote to-fade-up">
  <h2>"{{ page.quote2 }}"</h2>
</div>


I guess a memory that I treasure is... I don't know! That’s a hard one. These are such ego-centric answers so far, but I would say that... I think the moment that I decided that I was going to go back to art school after having done all this other stuff. When I was 25 I was like, “I’m gonna go back to art school.” I did this insane thing where I made a portfolio within a month and sent it to Sheridan. So I quit my job in December, and then in January, I'm all like, “I dunno what I'm doing.” Then my friend, who was in animation at the time told me, “Well Sheridan does portfolio submissions.” So he’s like, “You have a couple of days to submit your application, and then you have like a month to send in your portfolio." So I did that because I didn't have anything else to do anyway, and I got in by the skin of my teeth. Then it was like... “Okay I got in!” I basically told my parents about it and at first they were... I remember my mom being kind of shocked that it was another university degree program; so potentially another 4 years of my life if I did the full thing. And her being kind of like... a little angry about it, I think... I remember feeling just really calm about it. Before whenever I tried to do anything I felt like I was being scrutinized in terms of where my life was going to go, what direction I was going and making sure that I’m projecting a sense of... forward trajectory. Every time it just felt like these false starts, because I would do it and I'm like, “I hate this shit”. So now I did this... I did this thing in a month and I got in, so it was like... enough... maybe more than what I even expected from myself. Then I was just like, “Okay so... the results of this portfolio are telling me that there’s things about myself that I don't even know yet—things that I can actually do.” This is what I wanted. My mom was upset about it, and for me to no longer be reacting to that, I was like, “Okay this is the right choice, even if she doesn't get it." For a long time you grow up thinking, “I want my parents to understand me, I want them to validate me, I need someone to tell me that I'm doing something right, that I’m on the right path.” But it got to a point where THIS happened, and someone that I would normally feel like... I really need to make sure that they approved... they're not getting it, and it was fine with me. So I realized it was a decision for myself. That was an important moment because I think I started to understand that people disagreeing with you, or people pushing back on you: it doesn't mean that they don't care. A lot of times it means that they do. It also doesn't mean that they’re trying to bring you down, you just have to use it as something to... someone can still care and not understand. Even if someone doesn't understand, it doesn't detract from who they are in your life. That was an important point for me to understand. The reality is that nobody is going to know what YOUR path is. Most of the time YOU don't even know. You just have to... do it, and just be like, “This could blow up in my face, but I'm just gonna do it.”

<h3 class="question">What is your most terrible memory?</h3>

OH. Yeah I have a lot of bad memories. Most terrible memory is probably realizing that I was emotionally invested in someone to a degree that I didn't even realize; I thought I knew, but it was actually more than that. So I had let this person in to my interior life, and I don't think that things really happened reciprocally. I don't know if it was part-way that this person decided to shut me out, or if it was from the beginning, but they had no intention or desire to open themselves up to me, even though it seemed like they were. So I think that was probably a pretty bad memory, but it’s also kind of... it taught me to understand myself more, people more, people in the world more. After that I think I struggle a lot with this kind of intense amount of shame from the fact that I actually let someone in. So there's this kind of thought that occurs where you’re like, “I should've known better.” I had friends that were telling me that there’s nothing wrong in opening yourself up to people, but I think like... so now I have enough distance where I can be a human being, and I have made it a judgement and I acted on that judgement. So I’m not an all knowing, all seeing kind of person and... it is what it is. Yeah I think it’s a pretty bad memory, cause there’s a lot of things that also happened beforehand. So it’s not like... its a really looong drawn out thing, but the interesting thing is... now I feel more autonomous than ever? I feel more self-sufficient than ever and I’m wondering... if that was just kind of... you almost feel like you’re masochistic in the sense where you value self-sufficiency over everything else. Even when shitty things happen you just kind of devalue the negative experiences and you're just like <i>(goofy manly voice)</i>, “What doesn't kill you makes you stronger," that kind of situation. I don't know if it’s a weird coping mechanism, but at this point... it is what it is, and there’s tons of people on the planet that have had similar experiences.

I definitely was tired of fitting myself into spaces that people allow me. I'm like this—take it or leave it. When someone says something that is <i>sus</i>... before I would just... joke around it, and then now I'm just like, “What do you mean?” and call them out on it.

<h3 class="question">If you knew that in one year you would die suddenly, would you change anything about the way that you are now living?</h3>

I dunno, probably quit my job since I only have one year to live. I don't wanna like.. I don't want to work at a job if I'm gonna die in a YEAR. Maybe travel somewhere that I haven't been to? Take a trip at least, probably reach out to people that I haven't reached out to in a long time, I feel like... I should probably let them know that I’m going to be dead in a year <i>(laughs)</i>. Just kind of a copey, farewell tour kind of thing. Definitely travel, quit my job; I’d cut out all the BS in my life essentially. I don't have to worry about savings anymore, and just be like... do whatever I want!

<h3 class="question">What role does love and affection play in your life?</h3>

<div class="quote to-fade-up">
  <h2>"{{ page.quote3 }}"</h2>
</div>

So... I’m wondering the difference between the both? Like the distinction affection and love? Yeah I have to make that definition. So I think affection would be... general, social warmth. Love is more like... people ACTUALLY care. Affection probably more when you’re socializing, and love is more when you’re around people that you actually want to be around. I think they’re definitely... you need them. I think I need to give love, as well as receive it. I think affection is... affection is like the veneer. So it’s nice... I guess? But it’s not, really; it doesn't sustain you, love is the thing that sustains you. There are people that are not very affectionate, but they really care about people, and they are genuinely invested in the well-being of others, I think I need I need to do that for the people in my life. It helps me when the people in my life did the same for me. Otherwise, it’s really hard to go through the day without knowing that... people that are thinking about your well-being.

Affection is like... lets say you have a friend—this has happened to me before—you have a friend and you tell them, “So there's this guy I really like and blah-blah-blah,” and they're saying supportive things like, “Ohh yeah, I hope things work out, he sounds like a great guy blah-blah-blah.” And then later you meet up in two months and you’re like, “Actually he was kind of a butt, so... I don't want to talk to him anymore.” And then they're like “Yeah.... I thought he was kind of...“ So as a friend, you’re trying to say things that are soothing, validating and supportive, but I think that it's more affection than it is love. I think if it’s love, to ME love is honesty, so to me love is someone telling me something that I don't want to hear, because they’re thinking of my well-being, someone who’s not afraid to make things uncomfortable. Affection again, to me is surface level; you know when you meet someone for the first time and you have really good first impressions of each other? You think, “We’re gonna be friends for life!” or, “I really like this person!” But that’s cause you’ve only just begun to know each other, you only see the surface. As you get closer you start to peel away this manicured appearance that everyone has, and you’ll get to these points where... you feel like you’re on the verge of getting into a conflict. Love... to me is when you’re willing to strip away the photoshopped version of yourself over time... for people to see you in all of your ugliness. So there’s good sides to you, there's ugly sides to you, everyone has this. I think love is when you are willing to share that with someone, you’re willing to share how ugly you are to other people and I don't think people can really do this with affection. I would say my parents aren't affectionate, but they're definitely loving.

<h3 class="question">Bouncing off of that, how close and warm is your family?</h3>

I mean I got into an argument with my mom telling her like, “I think our family’s really cold,” that’s what I said at the time. I still think that we’re fairly... I think emotionally reserved to a certain degree. Not that we don't feel emotions, but I think it’s maybe because of my parent’s generation; they did not express things in a way that is of how I see myself and my peers expressing ourselves. It was such a different time: large families... born and raised in Hong Kong, large Chinese families... you don't talk about this stuff—feelings as much, right? But I learned to understand that people will love you in their own ways, and you can either fight against the way they choose to show that they care and be like, “Well why can't you hug me the right way?” Or you could understand that this is what they're doing to show that they care; you don't get to choose that. You could either learn to understand that or you could just... stay mad or whatever. You eventually understand that, and you start to see your parents as more like... ACTUAL human beings than parents. I think the sooner you get to that, it’s easier to navigate those feelings with them.

<h3 class="question">Help me complete this sentence “I wish I had someone whom I could share....”</h3>

Whom I could share... my ambitions.  Right now, I am in a very selfish phase in my life... so there are things that I want to do, other things that I wanna try, and I think it’s important for me right now for people to understand that there’s gonna be days where I'm gonna be emo as hell, cause I'm all stressed. But overall I'm doing what I want to be doing, or trying the things that I want to be trying, and I need make sure... I need to know... or I wanna know someone that understands that.  The people that I kind of really end up opening up towards more are people who understand desire. There’s a lot out there, and there’s a limited time that you’re on this planet.

<h3 class="question">What do you like most about yourself?</h3>

Uhm... NOT evil... yeah. I’ve had people tell me that I’m a nice person, and I don’t really know if that’s a compliment? But I think I’m empathetic enough—I don't need to be more empathetic <i>(laughs empathetically)</i>. Maybe that was more something that people like about me? What I actually like most about myself is that... that I haven’t given up yet.

<h3 class="question">Can you share an embarrassing story?</h3>

Okay this is just the first thing that’s coming up in my head, I don't even know if its just something thats embarrassing from just telling you. When I was a kid, I was over at a childhood friend’s house and I saw that they had pizza-flavored Pringles, and I really wanted to eat those pizza-flavored Pringles... I didn't wanna be just like, “Hey I wanna eat your Pringles” So I saw them on the shelf, I was holding the Pringles... and then I was like... being all nonchalant and shit, like I was thinking I was being really slick. I went into the other room where everyone else was and was like, “So uhh, do you guys have like, Pringles?” And they all TOTALLY knew.. .they knew that I was eyeing these pizza-flavored Pringles so they just started laughing and they're like, “Do you want the pizza-flavored ones?” I was pretty embarrassed, so there’s that.



<h3 class="question">When did you last cry in front of another person, to yourself?</h3>

Oh okay, in front of another person... maybe they couldn't see I was crying cause it was dark, but probably in... August I think (4 months from this interview). I was just telling them about someone in my life that I just couldn't see myself keeping a friendship with. So I was hanging with my friend James, and we were hanging out the whole day. Near the end of the day, I basically was talking about this guy that I had really liked for a long time, and then I realized that I couldn't be friends with this person anymore because they were basically... that was the person that I mentioned before, that I don't think took me seriously. I got to a point where I'm just like, “Are we going to... be dating or whatever?" They don't want a relationship with anyone, but they still hoped that we could be friends. So I was like, “I don't know...” I gave myself some time off, and then I get back to him like, “Okay well... I still like talk to you, so we can try to be friends...” The moment I realized that I couldn't be friends would be after when I said that, and he was trying to be... he was still trying to get with me. But I just wanted to be friends, and he just felt like... what that I would be so into you that I would just go for it ant any moments notice? I just felt really insulted and I felt that... I don't think this is right for me? I still knew that for whatever reason I’m still attracted to this person, but for my own well-being I don't think if I could still be friends unless this person initiates an apology, or just tries to understand me more... and I don't think that’s possible. So I told my friend James about this guy at the end of that day. It took a really long time because he actually worked with him. I introduced James to this guy, because he wanted to work with him—he’s someone who’s a little older. So.. this is someone that my friend James kind of looked up to, and I told him, "I just needed to tell one person and it’s going to be you. I need to tell you this so I could just... let this go.” I personally understood what I needed to do, but it still weighed heavily on my mind—it really affected my own self-esteem. So I told my friend, and literally right after telling my friend, there was this... acceptance. There was this like, “Okay, I’m not the only one thinking about all this in my head now because I’ve told this other person, and they are validating my point of view.” And so... it sucks because in a way I didn’t want it to affect him (James), but I was like, “I think as a friend you’d probably want to know that I was struggling with something.” I told him that, and it was really... probably like a tear while we were talking about it. So that was the last time I cried in front of someone.

The last time I cried to myself was like... I dunno.. so there's deep reasons, and there’s stupid reasons. But i’ve definitely cried watching some movies on Netflix. These days I cry over the dumbest things... I think it was... OH! Fantastic beasts and where to find them. At the end (SPOILERS), the guy Newt and the American lady: he’s about to get on his ship and go back to England, and he likes her I guess and he's like, “I'll give you a signed copy of my book when I publish it,” and then she's like “Yeah I’d like that,” and I just started crying and I'm like, “This isn't even sad I don't even know why I'm crying.” I mean know I’m crying, but I’m just kind of... wow I'm at this point... I think after everything that’s happened in my personal life... I really appreciate when people care. So over the past two years I’ve learned tp really appreciate my friends, I really understood the depth of friendship, and how deep that could be. So not only was it this situation with this guy, I also broke up with my boyfriend.

<h3 class="question">Ohh, I thought that guy WAS the boyfriend.</h3>

Nono, this was just a guy. My boyfriend I went out with... 12 years, he was my first boyfriend. So I was never really single for my entire adult life, right? So now i’m single, and I went through some weird shit, and... I think having friends that really care deeply, being there for me when I was like, “I dunno what I'm doing! I don't have the answers to anything,” and wanting to take care of me, I think it really helped me understand that it’s... it’s.. thats the difference between affection and love!

<h3 class="question">What, if anything is too serious to joke about?</h3>

I never really understood why on the internet... well I kind of understand, but I don't really enjoy people making suicide jokes. Cause people... die in real life? I have a friend who lost a sibling to suicide as well... and then there’s just people who really are struggling with depression and mental health, and I think it’s... I feel for someone to be able joke about it, it’s because they haven't really been there before. It seems like something so far and removed, right? People prematurely dying, people taking their own life... something that would never touch their reality. I will tell you that... I think a good number of people, by the time they reach 30 will know someone who has died before they thought they would, either by suicide or something else.

<h3 class="question">What is currently creating buzz in your professional field?</h3>

Buzz? uhmmm. I guess like... 3-D, in like... animating? It's not really new, but I think the field that I’m in is still in a state of flux, talking about illustration like ,“Print is dead... yada yada yada.” So a lot of illustrators that had maybe followed a more traditional editorial path are now looking at different ways to utilize their skills and make their own livelihood through that. What’s interesting to me is more... I dunno if it’s industry buzz, but interesting technologies like augmented reality, things like that, that’s kinda cool. But yeah, I think... I don't think it’s so much of a buzz, moreso people running around with their heads cut off like, “What do we do? What do people like to do now?” But the lifecycle of what’s interesting is constantly changing.

<h3 class="question">What is something about you that people should know?</h3>

<div class="quote to-fade-up">
  <h2>"{{ page.quote4 }}"</h2>
</div>

What people need to know meeting me for the first time is that... don’t agree with everything that I say. When I meet people—I don't know if it’s because of the way that I talk—but I’m not necessarily someone who would be like, “I dunnoooo but like... this?” I'll just say it. If somebody is... if they disagree, they can disagree. I kind of find that more interesting, I’m not seeking validation, I just want to have an interesting conversation. If you actually disagree with me, or have a different opinion on something.... I’m all ears. It's a first impression also, I'm just kinda like, ”You don't believe in your own thoughts enough? To express them?”

<h3 class="question">If you were to die this evening with not opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not telling someone. Why haven't you told them yet?</h3>

I don't know if there’s anything that I need to tell... anyone.... anything... I don't have any knowledge that other people don't know, that they need to have.

<h3 class="question">Your house, containing everything you own catches fire, after saving your loved ones and pets, you have enough time to make one final dash to save any one item in your house, what would that be?</h3>

So I can only have one item? uhmm... I dunno my laptop? It’s for practical reasons I guess? I have stuff... but I don't know if I’d be really sad at all if they all burned really.

<h3 class="question">Can you share a personal problem that you’re going through right now and what you’re planning on doing to resolve that.</h3>

I think just making sure that I’m taking care of myself? I think mentally... again, with that whole thing about me dealing with stress and stuff. I know that I am at a point in my life where I’m really trying to push towards something. So not being stressed is not a realistic option, because I know there’s this like... conflicting message of, “Rise and grind” kind of thing, but then there's also #selfcare; they're just two conflicting messages, right? I know that you can’t do both at the same time... at least in the way... your first impression of that. If you want something, you have to give something. So it's more kind of like, understanding... tendencies when I'm under stress and making sure that I’m not coping with that in a way that is detrimental to my health, and detrimental to the people around me. To understand, “Oh when I'm stressed, I... just don't want to be around people,” or like, “I tend to take on more stuff than I need to because I feel the need to be at a certain level at all times for everyone.” So just kind of reminding myself that I need to be ready for when I get stressed out. And so I have to be a lot more... I have to give lee-way to not put myself into a corner. So now for example, I’m working at just... I’m not going to agree to things until it’s later on. Events, obligations and stuff, I need to give that space for myself... to be myself. Being more selfish honestly, and not being bothered if people think that I’m being selfish. It's like ,“Okay I am sometimes, so what?”.

<div class="quote to-fade-up">
  <h2>"{{ page.quote5 }}"</h2>
</div>

The most psychotic thing that I realized about myself is that when I’m stressed: when I know there’s shit to do... what I do is that I give myself more shit to do... because—it's a counter-intuitive thing—I'm like, “Oh yeah, I got a lot of stuff...” and then my initial response is like, “Ooo that’s a lot!”  And then I'm just like, “No, fuck yourself, you’re gonna sign up for this other thing too, you're gonna DO IT.” If I’m doing MORE than what I initially said I was going to do, and I’m still handling shit, that means that I’m functioning. Which is really, like again a masochistic way of coping with life? Better than going to yourself like. “Yeah I'm just gonna eat chips in bed.”

<h3 class="question">So my go to reason for that would’ve been something along the lines of making work for yourself so you bury yourself in that, consistently working so you don't have to think about these stresses, but it seems like you’re doing it so that you could maintain a working “mood”? So you could transition to actual work easily?</h3>

Well it’s kind of like, I have responsibilites at my jobs, and I get certain things out of it, but I dont get everything that I WANT out of it. This is taking me more energy... and I get A and B, but I don't have C and D. So in order for me to feel like I’m still making a worthwhile use of that week, I’m gonna add C and D in my spare time to make sure that I’m making the most of that week. But that, on the other hand is stretching yourself thin.

<h3 class="question">Any last words of advice?</h3>

Care about people... like ACTUALLY care. I think it goes a long way when you... really care. I feel like some people think that they do, but... not really, you know? Really think about why you’re doing something.
