<h1 class="to-fade-up">So...</h1>

Born in Hamilton... and I was probably one of the troublemaking kids, little smart-ass... those up to no good, always getting into trouble ones. I guess I was doing well in school though, so it didn't really matter... well to my parents I guess? I was in Hamilton all the way up til I finished university,  and college after that. High school... was just A BLUR. I was there for five years and it was... it was really... it was boring.  Literally nothing to do: played some sports and then... just hung out with people, partied every weekend. Just CHILLIN with people and partying in the weekend, that was pretty much just EVERY weekend in high school. I was just like, “This is such a waste...” but I was getting above-average grades... yet I wasn't doing anything really, so I'm all, “Okay.. this is not right.” I hear like people in other high schools that go to university and their like “Oh my God I have so much work to do,” they've already prepared for it. When they go to university, they're already... they know how to study already, and I'm like, “Wh-what..? What happened to our high school, where was OUR prep?”

I remember when I was younger I saw, in Gore Park, (That's in downtown Hamilton),  I saw breakdancing for the first time. I kinda asked my mom, “What is that, what are they doing?” And she's like, “Ohh it's <i>huk gwai lo</i>,” which is like... "black people dancing," and I'm like “What the hell??” So my MOM was always like... she’s a pretty big dancer too, but she always wants to push me into ballroom, waltz and all that other whatever... contemporary dancing. So I started university and I was like, “Oh my god, there's a breakdance club here!” FIRST thing I did was join it, and before I knew it, I go so addicted. Sometimes I say to myself, “Do I go to class, or do I go to session?” You know some of those night classes are like six to nine? Like that’s session time! Sessions from six-thirty to TEN... can I spare this ONE class? I mean I have a seven in this class right now... I think I can do it. So yeah, to be honest some classes I did skip and went right to session.  I was riding high basically, for so long. "Man this is amazing, I have so many new friends that dance different mediums." I started travelling too. I think you remember that.. but when I was going to freestyle sessions, we went to like New York, we went to Evolution... and everything. Had a pretty bad knee injury too... but I guess we'll touch on that later.


Also recently my company shut down... learned a lot there about the movie industry, about 3-D programs and programming in general. So I moved departments: from the art department to the research and development department. To myself I'm like, “Maybe I should just be a full dev now... instead of like... art... like fuck this art shit (within the company), it doesn't PAY anything... there’s no FREEDOM, you always have to answer to someone, you can't just make your own things." In the end, I was just straight up learning programming; I wasn't doing anything related to work anymore... just studying my own stuff. It pretty much was like... the second coming of my broken knee, same deal <i>(laughs)</i>. I mean if it’s any indication or related to how my knee went, things should be good.

<h3 class="question">What are some problems that you experience, that you don't think other people might be running into?</h3>

Time. Time and effort. We’ll use dance as an example. When you dance, you’re... you only have a limited amount of time before your body starts to give in... you can do as much maitena—... I mean there’s people like Flo Master, like... Poe One, those guys are old... oh and Storm... those guys are OLD, but they maintain the body—they're still doing all those crazy moves right now to this day. I would say they're the exception, not the rule. I mean how many people do you see come into dance session, they finish and they just go home? They don't stretch, they don't do any body maintenance or anything like that, you know what I mean? Your body, it needs to be... in tune, or else it's not gonna work... like next year.. or the year after... but yeah... that's something that people don't really consider.

<div class="profile_extra1">
  <img src="{{ page.images }}3.jpg" alt="sexy girl">
</div>

<h3 class="question">If you could invite anyone to a dinner party, dead or alive who would you invite?</h3>

FOR SURE Anthony Bourdain, that guy is just... he’s so smart  and he also knows... he just knows all the foods in the world. Like you HAVE to HAVE him. You can’t have a dinner party now, or even before back when he was alive... you can't have a dinner party without thinking, “Okay Anthony Bourdain has to be there.”

I also want Terry Crews. He’s... he’s intelligent man! He’s... he’s got a LOT to say, he’s really smart... and he’s .. he looks like he’d eat. I actually do the intermittent fasting because he does it.

And then next person would be... Rosa Parks.. yeah... Rosa Parks. It’s just having someone from a different time, and then have them... just talking to them like, “Yo what’s going on here, what were you saying? What made you say this or whatever?” and, “How was that like?"

Last person.. probably Steve Jobs... ahh actually naw fuck Steve Jobs... Elon Musk. My hero: Elon musk. He’s huge, he’s doing things and he’s... I mean with Steve Jobs he was good at what he did, but that guy was a friggin' moron man... a  dumbass. You have pancreatic cancer... AND they caught it early. Now you’re just drinking vegetables to cure it are you DUMB? You couldn't envision a way for you to like... (chuckles) Coulda been like “Hey Siri, what’s a good way to get rid of my cancer?” And he, you know... goes to chemo.

<h3 class="question">Would you like to be famous one day? If so in what way, if not, then why?</h3>

Yeah I’d wanna be famous. Well I’d be famous more than I’d wanna be rich. Famous.... you can make money off your fame in whatever way... but you also have influence—you can spread messages. So a lot of people who are famous don't really think about that. You have influence over people... so no matter what you say, negative or positive, they’re listening and they’re watching. So I’d say... definitely something positive... something definitely positive... something positive and innovative... how about that?

<h3 class="question">Can you describe the perfect day?</h3>

They ask me this on every survey I do... they TELL you to type it in <i>(laughs)</i>. They LITERA-... alright, I’ve already got this...

OKAY, so wake up in the morning, got my snowboard and all my other gear or whatever. Get a helicopter that flies me up to the top of a mountain, go snowboarding for a whole day with whoever wants to go, and then... come home at night, get a nice beef stew going... in like a cabin or like a chalet or whatever. Get all my friends there, and we eat... board games... drink... party and just... just dance. Dance for the rest of the night, and then just wake up, do it all again.

<h3 class="question">When was the last time you sang to yourself? When was the last time you sang to someone else.</h3>

OHH <i>(laughs)</i>... UHHH... sang to myself? I guess a boring answer would be in the shower... I was singing this song uhh (looks for the song in this phone, plays it), this song. "Ooh I Wonder,” by Dr. Packer.

Now to someone else... Ho-ly... I don't think I've EVER sang to someone else... no I'm not THAT kind of romantic <i>(laughs)</i>. Maybe... MAYBE one day when I meet that right girl... and I'm like, “Yo THIS girl is the one.” If she’s that DOWN girl, like she's the ONE... then maybe... maybe. Maybe I'll sing some uhh... I would sing probably like... Frank Sinatra or something, or Paul Anka <i>(laughs)</i>. She can read this and I'll tell her, “You're the FIRST one girl, see how special you are?”

<h3 class="question">For what in life are you most grateful for?</h3>

<div class="quote to-fade-up">
  <h2>"{{ page.quote1 }}"</h2>
</div>

I wanna say... you know as much as people rag on the healthcare here, I’d say the healthcare... FREE healthcare. My grandma passed away last year... and she went to the hospital and we didn’t have to pay for ANYTHING. She was taken care of, she had her own nurse, like a personal nurse in the I.C.U. All the doctors came in: did all their procedures and everything, made her comfortable and she just... you know... In the STATES that would cost like what $600,000? Put the whole family in debt, just to like... for the rest of their lives? My dad also had a heart attack, he had go through open-heart surgery and... it was a quadruple bypass and THAT was free. He had the heart attack, he went right in, they did whatever and it didn't cost us a dime. Like what, it costs me 13% of what I buy, 22% of what I make, versus getting charged those obscene amounts? I’d say that’s still pretty fair—30% of your income. And my surgery, everything there was free too. Just went in... doctor gave me props and he's all like, “Yooo what's up man, I'm gonna be cutting your knee open,” and I'm like, “For real man?” And he's just like, “Yeah can you pull up your shorts up real quick?” He just drew on my knee with a marker and he's all like, “Alright! let's go!” Then the anesthesiologist comes in and he's like, “Hey man. uhh... I'm just gonna take your weight and we’re gonna inject some ‘fun juice’ in you.”  Then... just... yeah... have all these doctors working around me, and I was in and out under eight hours—in and out of the hospital.

<h3 class="question">If you could change anything in the way you were raised or how you grew up, what would you change?</h3>

Not much really. Maybe I would’ve visited my grandma more... uhmmm... probably... (chuckles) Should’ve taken school more seriously. High school... I started taking university more seriously later on, but I mean high school, probably should’ve taken it more seriously. Could've been like... could've been NASA right now... though it’s not too late, but I mean everyone else has a ten year start <i>(laughs)</i>.

<h3 class="question">If you could wake up and gain any ability or character trait, what would it be?</h3>

Like a super ability? Okay uhmm... traits can be learned and unlearned... so I'm just gonna say a super power. I'm gonna go with telekinesis—anything with the mind. You can move things with your mind, you can move people... and the other part of it usually it's like, you know... mind reading. Oh there was a book... uh... what was it called, it was short story actually actually. It was about someone that could read people’s minds, and they’re saying how its not actually good... that we're better off not being able to read people's minds and that it’s better that people can read YOUR mind. It's weird... yeah it was one of those short stories you just read. Cause it's like nobody knows what you’re thinking... but if they knew what you were thinking exactly, they would know how to empathize with you... like, “Oh shit this person’s sad because reason... they’re mad at me, but they’re not REALLY mad at ME: they’re mad at something that happened.”

<h3 class="question">If a crystal ball could tell you the truth about yourself, you life, the future or anything else, what would you wanna know?</h3>

Hummm... FUT-URE eh?... I don't believe in looking into the past and like... that, like, “Let’s just regret.” I’ve already done this and I know what happened. Can I do more than one question?

<h3 class="question"><i>(laughs)</i> Just the one</h3>

<i>(laughs)</i> If so I would just ask something stupid like, “How many cows I have eaten?” There’s that one stupid question like, “How many cows have you eaten in a lifetime?” People apparently eat something like... eight or nine or something. Anyways...to answer the question, probably looking into my future in terms of the tech industry: am I insignificant, am I significant, am I making an impact? Or am I homeless?

<h3 class="question">Is there anything that you dreamed of doing for a long time? Why haven’t done it?</h3>

I guess... go hunting? I dunno... climbing  I'm already doing that. ALL the dreams I want I'm pretty much already doing it—I'm doing them now. You know what? I’d say like... take a girl out on a real date. I actually HATE dates... so much that I have never... never ever asked a girl out on like a “date.” But like... I guess i would take a girl out on a real... not a on a real... let me rephrase that not on a REAL date... but a CRAZY date. Like, “Hey lets go and take this helicopter ride up to this... this treetop. Let's have dinner under there or something, then let's like... rappel back down or something—zip-line across the trees back down. We’ll look to the side and see the city while rappelling, see all the lights and it’ll be some crazy shit.” But girls like that don't exist. <i>(laughs)</i> At least I haven’t found her yet... there’s no... there’s no girl that I know right now in my life that would probably do that with me. If I asked a girl out like that, I'm like, “Hey, would you go... you wanna go zip-line this tree and have dinner on to-...” Naw. I don't even know if this girl’s going to be in Toronto <i>(laughs)</i>.

<h3 class="question">I mean it’s possible she's in Toronto <i>(laughs)</i></h3>

<i>(laughs)</i> You think she's in Toronto? I don't know man.. maybe she’s in like.. Europe or something.

<h3 class="question">What is your greatest achievement?</h3>

Hmm... oh that's a good question, it's making me thinking all introspectively like... OH I get it, it’s called “The intro!" <i>(laughs)</i>

<div class="quote to-fade-up">
  <h2>"{{ page.quote2 }}"</h2>
</div>

Recovering from that knee injury. That shaped a LOT of who I am actually. Cause like, you don't realize how much... how much of a mental impact it actually has on you—when you’re not about to do something that you really love. So I admit that I was like... I kind of went through a depressive state? I'm pretty sure... I studied psych right? Yeah I'm pretty sure I had depression. It was just like, “HO, MAN,” like... some days  all the symptoms are there: I get up I'm like, “I don't wanna do anything, I don't wanna wake up, I don't wanna go do THIS, I can't run, I can't walk, I can't do this... most important of them all I can't DANCE." I was pretty scared to do the surgery too. I woke up one day, and my knee was locked in bed, and like... I couldn't straighten it. So I'm like, “MOM.. GO..GO to the.. GO TO THE HOSPITAL!” She takes me to the hospital, the doctor... actually he passed away recently R.I.P. He was the one who was like, “Okay, you have two choices: you can try to live with it, or you can get surgery. Either way you gotta get an M.R.I. just to see, but I'm pretty sure you have a torn meniscus." So I was like, “Okay well, lets just try to ride it out and see what happens.” I rode that out for like a YEAR... didn't get used to it. I was just, I tried to continue and I couldn't... I got even MORE depressed cause every time I tried to dance, my knee would just lock up.

It started taking a toll on me, and one day I'm like, “OKAY, I'm playing a lot of games right now, I... don't have a girlfriend, I'm like NOT happy, so how can I even GET someone to be happy with me? Well... maybe I should just do it now." Got that surgery, and then... HO-LY SH-. Let me tell you... THAT YEAR of... I had a YEAR and a half of physio basically. It was a YEAR recovery—trying to learn how to run again. I signed up for the gym,  I was doing squats every other day. I couldn't touch my heel to my ass, I couldn't squat down and I couldn't bend over to pick things up. So I just had to work my ass off with squatting like crazy and eventually got up to like...THREE plates. Just squatting until I'm like ,“Okay this is strong enough, now is time for mobility, strength is there... let's work on mobility.”  I started going to physio two, sometimes three times a week; that was really expensive but I didn't care.

So I worked with that physio guy for like... SIX MONTHS. Finally I'm like, “OKAY! back to my first session.” I had to RELEARN everything, I was like, “MAN, I can't do ANYTHING right now.”  Fast-forward a couple of months... got down with my crew, World Serpent and then... big help was actually this one person... he's like... brought me back to the breaking world. He's like, “Okay this is the shit that I've been working on since you were gone and I'm gonna teach it to you now.” I started learning all of this new stuff and I'm like, “Holy crap, so this is my new take on break," and I'm able to have a fresh new start. I started making new friends again.. and then... pretty much, just new breath of life: now I'm doing moves that I never would've dreamed of trying before, like trying to hit HALOS and shit. I mean it's pretty good right now. <i>(smiles)</i> I'm just dancing more for fun now, trying to... be ME.

That year... ugh, I don't want to ever relive that again... it was crazy man. The achievement itself is being able to get down on the floor and do one round of six-step... after a year and half of physio and recovery.

<h3 class="question">What do you value most in your friendships? What do you expect from a best friend?</h3>

<div class="quote to-fade-up">
  <h2>"{{ page.quote3 }}"</h2>
</div>

You know a best friend is a lot like... a girlfriend... or it SHOULD be a girlfriend, but a best friend first. That being said, I think... a best friend needs to be someone whose honest. Oka first of all honest, and they have to be direct. No beating around the bush, they need to check you, like if you’re being too high and mighty and whatever, they need to check you back down to earth. <i>(laughs)</i> If you’re too low, like all hard on yourself, they need to carry you and push you back up. They should be inspiring, you know? You should be able to be happy when they’re happy, and then kinda like... understanding when you’re not. I think that’s a good friend.

<h3 class="question">What is your most treasured memory?</h3>

Oh, there's a lot. This one time when I was snowboarding, I got separated from everyone. It was at Mount St.Louis Moonstone, and one of the runs is... it faces away from the city, over to a horizon. I just sat there and kind of just like... I didn't know where I was, people just going by me... I was just sitting there and watching the sunset. I didn't feel the cold or anything, I didn't hear anything... I just sat there for like 15 minutes, watching the sunset.

<div class="profile_extra1">
  <img src="{{ page.images }}2.jpg" alt="sexy guy">
</div>

<h3 class="question">What is your terrible memory?</h3>

Most terrible memory? I would say... the one where you had.. that party. That dude that punched you? It was... fucking.. ugh... man. Cause I like... I felt almost powerless... It was just watching it happen and I'm just like, “Oh shit,” just moved and sprung into action, but I couldn't really just do anything after that because like... everyone was just on me... just bullshit.

To tell the story, we’re sitting there on the porch... eating spaghetti, talking to the girls at like.. two in the morning. Then that one guy... he comes out and... they were about to leave or something and we’re just sitting there eating. So we started laughing, and then he suddenly just pushes me and you stood up and told him like, “Yo man... don't do that,” And then I was just.. just kinda sat there, and I put my spaghetti down and I'm like, “Is this guy really trying to start a fight right now?” I get up and I'm like, “Okay... whatever you guys are gonna do, don't do it.. or whatever.” And then... and then... I dunno, those other dumbasses come out and they're all, “Oh.. oh hey man, you better shut the fuck up or we’re... we’re gonna fight you.” So two guys come to me, and one of the girls try to hold one of them back. I square up with this one dude, and I'm ready to fight and then like... and then I see YOU, scuffling with someone else. I think they were trying to push you or something? I'm like, “Well okay, this guy’s gonna get double teamed, I gotta go help him,” and then I ran over. That’s when that other dude sucker punched you. As soon as I saw that, I was like, “Oh my god...” and then like... then I jumped on him, the rest of the them just jumped on me. The girls eventually helped break up the first, cleaned you up... drove you to the hospital. Just so many emotions... it made me so mad... it made me so like, “Ugh man... why do people do this stupid shit? what’s your problem man, what’s wrong with you?"

<h3 class="question">If you knew that in one year, you would die suddenly, would you change anything about the way that you are living now?</h3>

No. No man, I mean I'm surprised that I even made it this far. I honestly think that I wouldn’t have made it to this age—that I would be able to live this long. I was just like, “You know what, I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do... if i die... then alright.” Now I'm like, “I'm still here, like what the hell?” So now I'm trying crazier things to try and die man! Like... friggin' climbed a mountain a couple of months ago... I'm just... what's the deal here, are you kidding me?

<h3 class="question">What roles do love and affection play in your life?</h3>

Okay so... let’s be real: love and affection is really hard in my family, for them to like... express. So even when my grandma passed, I was surprised man... I was just like, “Who do I talk to about this?” Nobody's really showing any emotion, my mom didn’t even cry until like the LAST day... when they were burying my grandma. I’m just kinda like, “Well okay, this is how it is then...” My dad too... really emotionally disconnected so he’s completely out of the picture for that kind of stuff.

<div class="quote to-fade-up">
  <h2>"{{ page.quote4 }}"</h2>
</div>

Honestly I haven’t found a girl... <i>(cracks up)</i>... OH MAN... Ohh I feel so bad... my... okay, okay put it in, put it in. She— okay. I think for me... I haven’t found a girl that I’ve been “in love” with. So like... I mean, my most recent girlfriend she.... I mean we told each other we loved each other, and I mean if we were IN love, we’d still be together, right? I haven’t found a girl that I actually was like... I love her, and I’m IN love with her, that kind of deal. I think there’s two tiers with this, you need to love, and then you need to be IN love. Cause you can love like... you love your friends, you love your family and all that stuff, right? But are you IN love with them? I think with affection, you can show it in different ways... affection, I think in the end goes with compassion—It’s about being nice to each other.

<h3 class="question">How close and warm is your family, what is your relationship with them?</h3>

My dad... nothing. We literally don’t talk; see him and it's like, “Hey,” thats it. Sometimes we drive far places and we don’t talk, like the whole way—an hour and a half. He's just... oh man... he’s kind of an asshole, and kind of bridges to my brother. So my brother’s kinda like that, but not really because he's smarter than my dad. At the same time, that makes him even worse because he’s... like I can’t speak to my brother freely about things. I have to choose my words really carefully when I talk to him, cause he’s vey condescending when he speaks to you. He downplays and minimizes anything that I do. So any little achievement... I don't... I don't tell him, right? I don't say anything to him about it. When I used to play pro-paintball, he’d be like, “Oh how’d that tournament go?” And I’d be like, “Yahh it's alright.’ Even though I destroyed everyone, got first place 3 times.. right? I don't say anything about it.

With my sister... she just... <i>(laughs)</i> Let’s just say she isn’t the smartest person in the family... to be polite. She’s not the brightest. She’s still there, she means well, but she doesn't go about things in the smartest way. She’s like... she’s the type that would read the Onion News and believes it. And then... she probably believes in the flat-earth sorta thing... I dunno man. We’re kinda close, not really but... she’s got my back... I think. We don’t really talk that much. I kinda try to help her like, “Hey, I think you should see someone about some of these things that you’re going through, and that you’re doing.” She's all like, “NO" and she gets defensive like, “There’s nothing wrong.”

Then my mom’s just... she’s just a mom: caring and she’s pretty smart, in a different way. She’s street smart, and she’s kinda... cunning.

<h3 class="question">Help me complete this sentence “I wish I had someone whom I could share...”</h3>

Mmm... long sleepless night with.

<div class="profile_extra1">
  <img src="{{ page.images }}4.jpg" alt="sexy girl">
</div>

<h3 class="question">What do you like most about yourself?</h3>

I’d say my curiosity... sometimes it’s a curse too, but I like it. It makes me think of things that I’d normally not think about, but then it keeps me up at night... it just snowballs, ugh. Sometimes I can’t sleep because of it, but curiosity it makes me wanna learn more: I guess it put me in the right path for like... programming and development. You have to alway keep researching.

I’ve just finished reading Neil DeGrasse Tyson’s book <i>Astrophysics for People in a Hurry</i>. From there, I looked into the cosmos or whatever, and then I was like, “Okay, so how can that model be applied to other places? Other places in the universe?” And like, “Oh that ties into string theory.” So I talk to my physics friend Mike like, “Mike, you know a bit about string theory right? I mean you did your thesis on it, can you point me in the right direction for books to read?” Then you just get deeper and deeper.. string theory touches on time... time goes into space... space and time together... that goes in to a whole other thing with physics, and then once you get in there, it kinda like... makes you think of how there’s things that we don't know... that we DON'T know. So there’s like... I mean the way that we perceive things, the way that we’re here right now... there might be beings out there that don’t breathe oxygen, or that don’t need light, and that don’t eat and don’t think like us; maybe they don’t need physical bodies. But they all.. and then their take on time is probably something entirely different... cause time is a man-made concept. I have a VR headset now.. and sometimes I just put it on at night when I’m about to go to sleep and I go through space... like deep space exploration and I just let it go and I'm like “Ohhh man." <i>(laughs)</i> “Where am i?”

<h3 class="question">Can you share an embarrassing story?</h3>

I don’t get embarrassed, but I think the closest thing would probably be... if I had to say one thing... At a club, I was with two other guys, and their sole purpose there (it probably sounds so scumbag), but we were here to just pick up girls. So I'm like, “Alright... I guess I'll just join in.” First group of girls I approached, right away they’re just like, “Nope. Not down.” Defenses went up, started saying things like, “We only like girls.” So now I'm all, “Alright I'm going home guys.” So those guys just started to laugh at me all like, “Ahh haa, look at this guy.” I sat back and just had drinks to myself instead, started talking to people. And I actually did meet a girl that night, but it wasn’t because I was trying to pick them up; I was just drinking at the bar, watching these two idiots try and go like... pick up girls. Then this one girl just started talking to me like, “What’re you doing, you up to?” And I'm like, “Just watching my moron friends trying to pick up these girls, look at them over there.” Then she starts talking to me all like, “Wow, they look desperate.” <i>(laughs)</i>

<h3 class="question">When did you last cry in front of another person? When did you last cry to yourself?</h3>

Probably at my best friends... one of my best friend’s funeral. That was pretty crazy, that was tough. I was... uhmm... I went to elementary school with him actually and then... when he passed a lot of my friends actually messaged me and they’re like, “Did you know this happened?” And I'm like, “What do you mean, what're you talking about?”  Suddenly, just six different Facebook messages. I see the obituary and then I'm like, “Awww man... are you serious? I have to find out this way?” I knew his brother too, he told me everything—what was going down... man I didn't wanna find out this way. When I went there, I was just like, “Okay... I'm not gonna cry, I'm not gonna cry,” and then, as soon as I got there, I walked in and I saw the casket... “Aww shit...” Saw his parents, his girlfriend... late-girlfriend crying too... that didn’t help.

Last time to myself, when I was... nine or ten maybe... after watching this Chinese movie <i>Beloved Son of God</i>. So this kid, he’s mentally challenged. He gets thrown around to these foster homes, and everyone’s always ditching him—throwing him on the street and stuff. Then eventually this social worker picks him up and tries to help him out. Then some freak accident happens and she’s like, “I'm gonna make a phone call in this phone booth, wait right here and we'll get ice cream and whatever.” So he’s waiting there, and she's in the phone booth, and then this freak accident—this car hits the phone booth, and she ends up in a coma in a hospital. So he's STANDING there still, doesn’t know what to do, right? Thinking, “Oh she's not coming back, she’s ditching me like all of the rest of the people,” and then he starts walking around... like wandering and stuff, and then eventually wanders into this jungle. This old witch doctor takes him in, and starts teaching him how to cure things. Eventually this woman wakes up from a coma and tries to find him: to take him back but he won't go. So even the witch doctor’s like, “Yo you have to go man, you can’t stay here anymore!” Yeah... that movie made me think like, “This is sad man.” So they try to forcibly remove him from the place... a bunch of the medicine cabinet stuff fell on him, hits him on the head... and he gets even MORE mentally challenged, and I'm like, “Damn... son.” So I finished it, went upstairs, started crying like holy crap.

<h3 class="question">What, if anything is too serious to joke about?</h3>

You mean in 2018? Or like <i>(laughs)</i>... For me, I think it’s all about the context. Sometimes... like you’re not gonna joke about rape to someone that got raped... that kind of shit? But you’re also... it’s hard to say right now, to see who would not get offended, and who would. I would say probably with context, nothing is off limits.

<h3 class="question">What is currently creating buzz in your professional field?</h3>

Virtual reality, and augmented reality... or all three, V.R., A.R., and A.I. Looking at Deloitte, they have an A.I. program, their software actually... it can read your emotion now I think, I forget what it was called. It's pure visual like it scans... kind of like how Snapchat has that facial recognition when you tap and hold, and it draws those polygons on you. Same with this, it looks at your face and it tries to read you emotions like, “Oh this guy is sad.” Was talking to one of my friends: working at Deloitte with machine learning. You feed this software like... hundreds and thousands of arbitrarily marked pictures of emotions, it's not machine learning. Machine learning it would be able to generate those kind of things by itself, to be able to teach itself how to do that instead of being fed.

In terms the dance community, think people are just kind of... a lot of people talking behind a lot of other people’s backs. You know back then when we first started and stuff? There’s was so much beef right? Everyone was just calling each other out, and then it kinda settled down. There’s a lot of crews now, and there's a lot of people who just talk shit about each other behind each other’s back. I think it's just... it’s cause just those social justice kind of things man... they don't wanna confront each other thinking they would offend each other. But I think overall, it is more unified than before. Back then, it was always like “breakers”, and then like... you’d see the one or two poppers and whatever—you wouldn’t even know about the other styles. Now it's like, everyone just knows each other: all the all-styles, breakers, they all know each other now, they’re all friends, all intermingling and dating, stuff like that. It’s a whole other thing coming in.


<h3 class="question">What is something that people should know about you?</h3>

I don’t really sugarcoat things. I’m a pretty straightforward kind of guy. I don’t really... it might sound rude sometimes, it might sound brash, but I mean it’s... do you want me to tell you in a nicer way that like, you’re doing something wrong or bad? I don't know, are you gonna learn that way? Do you want me to sugarcoat how you're gonna cut your finger off, instead of me telling you, “Yo, don’t cut your finger off?”

<h3 class="question">If you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you regret not having told someone, why haven't you told them yet?</h3>

I’m just gonna die like, tonight? Probably the generic, like last word kind of thing, “I’m sorry, I still love you all, go do something worth your life... don’t be a WASTEMAN.” <i>(laughs)</i> “Go be somebody.”

<h3 class="question">Your house, containing everything you own catches fire, after saving your pets and loved one, you have enough time to make a final dash to save any one item, what item would that be?</h3>

<i>(laughs)</i> My computer, <i>(still laughing)</i> so bad... YO, my tower man. My life’s work is on there. Even though I have things like cloud storage... it's not enough, I only have like 100 GB of cloud storage man; we’re talking about 2 TERABYTES of information man. Yeah, I’d take the tower.

<h3 class="question">Can you share a personal problem that you’re going through right now, how do you planning on solving that issue?</h3>

I’m at this point where... I think I’m trying to date, but I'm not really? I don't know if it’s because I'm just really focused on work and career shit, and  personal stuff? Or I’m just not... emotionally available or even care. I don't know, sometimes I meet girls, I'm like, “Oh, they’d be cool to date,” and I ask them out, but then later on you just kinda lose interest, or I just don’t feel motivated to do it anymore. So I dunno if it’s because... and then, the girls that... sometimes I think that they like me, but I don’t really... reciprocate the feelings—feel like I just need to care more. So, okay... there was a point where I think I cared too much about things, and then I stopped caring altogether, and now... just at the bottom where I don't care about anything. Like literally, don't care, I just care about myself and like... I think that’s pretty bad. Cause you’re all just emotionally unavailable to people, and they kinda wanna talk to you... or they kinda want... they wanna be friends, and you can't even give them that.

<div class="quote to-fade-up">
  <h2>"{{ page.quote5 }}"</h2>
</div>

That’s the thing... I’m still social, it's just like, “Do I really care what this person has to say?”  and THAT's bad. Kind of like, “Alright, can I speak to this person without... without a personal agenda?” And then like... sometimes I do, sometimes I really enjoy talking to this person, I wanna get to know them. But then it’s like, “Alright, where’s this going?" Am I just trying to be friends with them, am I trying to date them? If it’s a guy, can I hang out with them again? Are we gonna do stuff later? Or it's just gonna be another person on my Facebook friends list? And it's just like... I mean I think I’m actively trying to be... more, “I really wanna get to know this person more,” or like, “Hey you wanna hang out?” And if they don't want to, fine.

Cause I mean before, I'm all, “Ohh this person doesn’t like me because they don’t wanna hang out,” and it’s... you don't know what going on in their life, maybe they're just busy or something, or they really just can’t hang out. Sometimes, maybe I give them mixed messages or something? To some people... to some girls, to some guys. I’ve asked to chill with a girl before, like just want to get to know her right? Just chill. And I use the same approach with another girl, and she's like, “Sorry, we can’t hang out alone because I have a boyfriend and..." Like what the hell? Like what? Okay... did I say something wrong here? I just wanna hang out; I said the same thing to this other girl, we still hang out, we’re still chill. So this is kind of why I kinda, I'm like, “Should I just stop caring again?” I don't really... if we don't chill, I care even less about you now... like even MORE if I have to go through that shit.

<h3 class="question">Any last words of advice?</h3>

When you decide what you want to do for the rest of your life... I would say that it satisfies at least these three things: does it help you grow in any way? Mentally? Physically? Does it help society in any way, besides paying taxes? Does it help... does it actually pay, is it feasible? That’s for like... career stuff I guess.

In life, I’d say... I mean I can just keep going on... old man rant right now. <i>(laughs)</i> Just be really open-minded: don’t be afraid to try new things. I’m kind of an impulsive person, so it might be different for me versus other people, but if you think you wanna try something, then go try it. I've only just started rock climbing a year ago, and I’ve never done it before. Always just thought, “Okay, this seems like it could be fun? I mean I liked climbing things when I was younger, who knows, maybe it'll be fun?” And I really got into it. If you ever decide to go into something that you really want to... whether you’re curious about, or like, impulsively got into... DON’T give up right away. Go in 110%, research everything about it, know the ins and outs of everything that you’re doing, know the people that you NEED to know, know the industry.  Give it a really solid chance, don't just like... try it once and then, “Oh I don’t like this,” and then be like, “Aww I'm out.” Try it a couple times, and then be like, “Oh, okay, this person does it like this way... this famous person, or someone that's talented in this area... maybe I should something similar, or like try to get to that point.” That's something to strive for.

Yeah, just keep an open mind when dealing with other people. Say, when you label people right away, it closes your mind off to what they could offer. Also, when I say open-mindedness... tryna see... different perspectives, and don’t just immediately close yourself off to other people based on what they believe or whatever. Cause that’s... <i>(groans)</i> So when people say like, “I only date Christians,” or like, “I'm this, and that, and I only date this religion.” You’ve just effectively cut off a huge portion of the world from your beliefs. You don't know, maybe it's someone who eventually wants to convert, or suddenly YOUR faith dwindles, and you need someone who’s NOT a christian or whatever. And then it’s kind of like... goes back to open-mindedness; take people for who they are. You can control your own emotions, so if they’re like a shitty person, like they’re just gonna be a shitty person, there’s nothing you can do about it. You can’t really change them... they’ve gotta change themselves eventually... for the better OR worse. Just deal with it as it goes.
