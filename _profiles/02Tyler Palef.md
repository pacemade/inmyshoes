<h1 class="to-fade-up">Oh man...</h1>

Alright, so the story starts... I was actually a planned baby, so we're going waaay back. Who I was... story of my life, good planning... <i>(thinks)</i> Actually it’s ironic, but I was planned so... I was in vitro, that means I was a petri-dish baby? My parents actually wanted me and from there and the rest of it is downhill!

Its sorta like, interesting to look back at your life and sum it up or say who you are. You wanna come off humble because you know how everybody sees themselves differently... still not answering the question yet. Who am I...? My childhood was... my parents did a really good job of trying to put my interests first. Did you ever have to get schlucked along when your brother had something to do? My parents were really solid in that they let me go home. So it’s like they really did a good job of putting me first. However, there were experiences that I feel I missed out on because they were so nurturing. Things like going to camp—I didn't like getting dirty so they’re like, "Oh you don't have to go to camp, thats cool," but like, you know... then you kinda miss that. Now I'm like what, 23, almost turning 24 and it'd be weird if I went to camp with a bunch of kids. But in the end I think my childhood was really good... lots of video games. I was a bit of uhhh... I think the guy that you know now—sorta jokey, that stuff... I wasn’t always like this. I really didn't come out of my shell until nearly the end of middle school, think the middle of grade 7, grade 8. Before then... super shy, very reserved. Uhhm... one of my birthday parties and this might be sad, though also funny. See I was stoked for the Gamecube to come out, so I got Mario Party and... have you ever thrown a party where only half the people come? Have you ever thrown a party where you only invited 2 people and only 1 one of them showed up? <i>(laughs)</i> It was something else, it was a time.

High school, kinda felt like things were falling into place a little bit; I didn't know what I wanted to be until maybe around Facebook? That sorta thing? Like I'm going to make an app, make a lot of money, all that sorta stuff... I never really considered myself someone who would work 9-5. Just do the one big thing, because to me... I value time really more than anything else in a way. I don't mind spending 30 bucks here and there, like almost in the way of shipping: do you wanna wait possibly 2-3 weeks for something or would you rather pay 50 bucks to get it the next day? That’s the same way I view time; I view my time as something worthwhile. I didn't want to be committed to somewhere like the place I used to work, where I had to commute—losing 8 hours a day basically. So that was a struggle... but in high school I was really high on myself and thought the world was my oyster.

<div class="quote to-fade-up">
  <h2>"{{ page.quote1 }}"</h2>
</div>

Come university: same sorta thing. I would say that the nurturing cycle of my parents carried over into... uhh... university! My first year was very much lazy—do the bare minimum and game the system. For example, professors want different things: so I would do what the professor wanted, get nothing out of it myself... but hey, I did well on my GPA. Anyways, I felt like I was living under my parents thumb a little bit and then come 3rd year: got a girl pregnant, have a baby... and that completely shifts your entire priorities. It sorta became like now... time wasn't yours, time was for your kid... and so, time where you wanna work out or play games or meet with friends, that became time dedicated to your kids. And I think that matured me in a way that with anything difficult before, I’d just be like, "Get out of the way!" Like I had a car accident when I was 16... hit by a drunk driver which sucked. I was fine he was fine, it was just a fender bender, and how did I get out? I just walked away from it like whatever... like scot-free pretty much; my insurance wouldn't go up because of the parameters of it. And so I felt like having a kid was the first time I did something that had consequences... or like, that had an impact. I think that was for the better, because it shifted me to the person I am now: to be more empathetic to others, to be more self-aware and caring and actually give a shit. I think that sorta... that was the start of me turning into the person that was responsible, and that wanted to lift other people up as well. And that’s sort of the person that you met, when you started working with me <i>(cute smile)</i>.

<h3 class="question">So from the unplanned baby, where did you go from there? How were you able to pivot as gracefully as you did?</h3>

The whole idea of making an app, THAT became this delusion of grandeur; the smoke and mirrors went away, like there’s only one Mark Zuckerberg. So from there I kind of scrambled like, "Okay whats a father supposed to be?" You have to earn money... so I started working at Ryerson, and I also got a job as a caretaker at a high school. So it’s just like, I started doing things that I actually would like. I had a job at Wonderland during first year university or whatever—I hated it. 2 months later I quit, cause my parents never forced me to work, right? Nurturing... again; I never had to do things that I didn't wanna do. It's something at the time if I didn't like it, I wouldn't do it. Now it felt like I didn't have a choice, and I was fine with it. You reap what you sow... I don't want to say it in a negative sense of having a kid, but it made me grow as a person, just somebody that I like a lot more now. You know Runescape? Where you’re on the tutorial island? That’s like before I had my daughter Zoe, but now after the tutorial; you take what you learned, and just go H.A.M.

So basically from there, my dream went away, just got be like, "Hey come on man get it together." I was really worried about getting a job after uni, and that’s where I started working as a tech support agent/lead. They initially asked for me to work at the start of the second semester, but I couldn't leave and NOT go to school. I mean that’s worse than not having a job, cause I had to finish my degree. So I was just like, "Why don't I start later?" They said, "Okay come back we'll call you later." Fast forward into March and they're like, "Okay, we have another job offer for you." At this point I felt like I deferred them once already—I can't do it again. So I took the job... started working in April, but school still didn't end for a couple of months. I just stopped going to classes... so while I was being trained, I was actually writing my philosophy papers, other papers, all that stuff. It was a total hustle, I actually... my university laptop I took to work: one day I had my coffee, my workbag, my laptop... dropped the laptop... right there, busted. So in short the pivot was, "Get working."

I felt like the father figure should be responsible, be the bread winner. It's a very outdated outlook you’d think, but at your core, you still feel like you want to take care of this thing that’s yours—you don't wanna rely on others. That was kind of the outlook... that’s why I jumped to the first job that came my way and worked really hard towards being able to work from home. Then eventually... basically two years of grinding at that job, having that focus of being the bread winner being ingrained in your mind; my girlfriend at the time, Zoe's mom was like over it, right? You choose between: being a good dad, being a good worker, being a good partner. Well I'm like, "I need to be a good worker because I needed to work from home... need to make more money... need to be a good parent because I value being a good parent," and then... you lose it (Zoe’s mother). It's kind of like that, "Sleep, study, friends," triangle you get when you were a student. So that was something that... of the three, pick two... I had to pick two. In hindsight I feel like I put too much into that job, but I have always been ambitious since having a kid because I want her to have the life I had, and when you’re single at the start of your career, you need to work really hard to get to the salaries my parents had when I was Zoe's age. So I'm always thinking, "How can I give her the things that I had as a kid?" That’s what motivates me.

<h3 class="question">So being a father and a full-fledged, full-stack developer, what are some problems that you dealt with that you think other may not have experienced themselves?</h3>

Yeaaah... I mean it's hard to find time, they say you want to code every day, like out of: Friday, Saturday, Sunday... I can only code Sunday night, because I'm with Zoe Friday, Saturday, Sunday. Honestly that works because if I was with her more; I'm just taking her to daycare and coding during the day. I’d say it's hard to find time for yourself... it really is, it makes your life kinda feel like... I’ve gained a lot of weight when I was working, being a good partner, and being with Zo. Because you have no time to be social, and maybe you get half an hour or an hour... it felt like a prison a little bit: where you just felt like you were constantly doing things that other people want. I think that’s what other people like, the teenage rebellion phase, like all "Don't tell me what to do". When I was working as tech support, thats what I felt like every single day... that I'm spending 8 hours doing something I don't really want to do, and then I have to see a movie that I don't really want to see, but I want to make her happy, and then after that I'm picking Zoe up and making sure she goes to sleep... and it's hard to get her to fall asleep. Then it's like... nine-thirty... I have work at seven in the morning the next day, maybe play games for an hour? Work out for ten minutes, <i>(laughs)</i> do a push up I'm done—I worked out. My whole life just sorta methodical: I check boxes, boom-boom-boom it's all an array. That’s how I kind of keep track of it, cause you’re really busy... you want to make sure you’re hitting your goals. I have a day planner but there’s also sorta similarities as well. So when you’re working in JavaScript and it's like you’re trying to call a callback function... it's like, "Oh it's coming back as undefined, I never declared this variable." Well same thing can happen with the kid, where it's like, "Do you want to go for a walk?" And it's like, okay... now your kid's confused. Now you’re like, "Oh, I never defined what walk was before, therefore the sentence doesn't make sense!" So you start thinking that it relates a little bit in the sense that kid's a little bit... you know, not super asynchronous.

<h3 class="question">Given the choice of anyone in the world, dead or alive, who would you invite to a dinner party?</h3>

That’s uhh, like uhh... how many people, just one?

<h3 class="question">You can do one or if there’s more than one then go for it!</h3>

I think if I could choose, I would probably choose both my grandfathers and invite my family as well. Kind of like... I mean hopefully they're not zombies. I kinda felt like they were role models—really big role models in my life. My mom's dad, my grandfather on my mom's side... he actually wasn't even my biological grandfather; they remarried years before I was born, but they always treated me like I wasn't any different. He liked baseball, I liked football, but he pretended to like football his entire life, and he watched football just so he could talk to me about it. Like that’s the kind of guy he was and he would never let you know. So I think that I would love to be able to sit down with him and get to reflect on where I am now. That and also my dad’s dad cause he was really funny, he was really cool, he always treated people with respect and both of them always dressed in suits all the time, it's like come on, we love our Jewish men.

<h3 class="question">Would you like to be famous one day? If so, in what way? If no, why not?</h3>

I think there're pros and cons to being famous, because you like being heard and... the pros of it is everyone likes you. At the same time... on the flip side, you could be like PewDiePie; you say the wrong thing and boom, vilified... its all over for you. Uhmm... or you know Elon Musk? Like how he was doing the blunt on the Joe Rogan show? It’s ONE thing, right? And everyone was crazy. For me personally, I'd rather be unseen and not be appreciated for that, but do a good job with whatever I'm doing, than be famous and then have to live up to expectations to other people.

<h3 class="question">For you, what would constitute the perfect day? From when you wake up to when you sleep.</h3>

Wake up, work on a passion project, do my Codewars, see Danny <i>(smiles handsomely)</i>, get interviewed. But probably get a couple of emails back about job stuff, because then I feel like I'm being productive and working towards something. Codewars also feels like I'm working towards something... flexing. Working out obviously to be healthier. Uhhm, review some past projects, just to get it to sink in better, get a better understanding. Probably seeing Zoe: taking her somewhere happy, making her smile, taking Instagram photos, that sorta stuff. Hitting the basis of self improvement, and when I'm with Zo, I value my kid right? So I wanna make sure that I... spend time with her, and then my girlfriend Michelle, hang out with her afterwards.

<h3 class="question">When was the last time you sang to yourself? and what song were singing, what were you doing?</h3>

Hmmmm... I definitely used to sing a lot more in the shower... I'm into old pop songs from the early 2000's, you know like Ashlee Simpson, Jonas Brothers, that sorta stuff. What was the last song though? It has to be very specific, uhmmm... shit... uhhhhhh, I know this.

<h3 class="question">We can come back to this <i>(laughs)</i></h3>

No no we're sitting here til' I got it, cause I know I was singing today. A lot of the stuff I listen to nowadays is like, instrumental you know? Cause it keeps you focused. I wanna say like the song I sing the most... my go to track is, "Burnin' up" by the Jonas Brothers. And that's a jam, "I'm hot you’re cold," that’s my karaoke jam, I'll go with that!

<h3 class="question">And when was the last time you sang to someone else?</h3>

I think it was like, me and my girlfriend sing in the car a LOT, so probably like Ariana Grande, probably like earlier this week.

<h3 class="question">For what in life are you most grateful for?</h3>

<div class="quote to-fade-up">
  <h2>"{{ page.quote2 }}"</h2>
</div>

Probably would be the people around me, because I'm a product of my environment and circumstances. I think from my nature, I'm somebody that... there was that quote by Anthony Bourdain, gosh I hope I said his name right. He had a quote like ,"Everyday I'm struggling with the guy in my head that's saying, 'stay in bed and do nothing'". Like that’s me at my core, everyday it's really hard for me to want to get out of bed... but, the people around me, Zoe inspires me to want to be a better father, work harder, be better to myself, be fit so I can carry her on my shoulders... girlfriend wants to hang out, wants to see new things, take her places, or even my friends: Danny, inspiring me going to a coding bootcamp and become a full-stack guy. Like even old close co-workers right? I'm one of the people that... see I don't necessarily... you know how theres that tacky saying about looking backwards and being than you were yesterday? I think that’s true, sure, and I like that, but it's also looking at people around you and making sure that you’re all moving up and like... you don't want to be the Yamcha, you don't want to be him, you want to be Goku.

<h3 class="question">If you could change anything in how you were raised, what would you change?</h3>

 I kind of wish my parents were a little less coddling; in the sense that I lived like 15 mins from school, but they wouldn't let me walk home until I was in high school. We’re a family that watched a lot of Law and Order, CSI, America's Most Wanted, so my dad is very protective and that sorta thing. I wish they had taken their foot off the gas a lil' bit, because it strayed me away from wanting to date anyone... it's just like, "Great I get to invite my dad too to this date." So kind of... I wish I had a bit more freedom to make my own mistakes as opposed to, "Don't do this don't do that."
>

<h3 class="question">If you could wake up one day, gain any any ability or character trait, what would that be?</h3>

For me, Spiderman's like that coolest hero... but I don't really want to fight villains. There could be other heroes, but like if I'm the only hero it's whatever. I think it would be cool to fly? Just cause you don't have to deal with traffic anymore. But I think the power I’d want to have is just to be more self-assured, which is pretty level-headed. I feel like as a coder, you kinda always deal with that imposter syndrome. I'd like to get rid of that—have more confidence in myself. The whole motto is like, "Always self-improve." For me I never feel like I'm good enough no matter what, and I kinda don't wanna show it. When I was a senior lead I didn't wanna show it, cause then you’re always second guessing yourself.

<h3 class="question">Is there something you have dreamed of doing for a long time? Why haven't you done it yet?</h3>

I kind of always wanted to pick up playing hockey. Yeah cause what I like about hockey is that the goalie is kind of like the pitcher in baseball: he can single handedly win the game. I like being able to carry a team, kind of like what I do with my projects <i>(laughs)</i>, just joking they're all great. For me: skating I can do, hockey I can do, I can't do them at the same time. That’s sorta why I’ve struggled and like... my parents took me to play football and baseball growing up as a kid, but I only did one winter camp as a hockey player and that was it. I wish I got to play hockey that age, so that I could be doing it now. Now if I'm trying to play shinny (pick-up hockey), I'm gonna suck, and if I wanna play, I gotta buy pads and everything. So the overhead and the buy-in is just too much.

<h3 class="question">What do you value most in your friendships? Can you describe a best friend?</h3>

I think the thing I value the most... the most common trait is that you can pick up where you left off with someone, without any awkwardness, no forcing a conversation just like, "Hey man!" It's kinda funny that every single one of my best friends... it's always like, "Yo beautiful, hey handsome," very homo-erotic. I’d probably say that... having THAT, it's basically just a continuous lull. A lot of my friends, since I had a kid would start a message on Facebook or text; I don't even reply for a day, or a couple of hours, cause I read it, and Zoe needs me and I forget. So it's one of those things... I appreciate those friends that have that patience that are willing to wait for me, and then also can pick up and kick it with me.

<h3 class="question">What do you think your greatest accomplishment is to this date?</h3>

I think that it's gonna be tacky, but probably Zoe... it's pretty obvious. You kinda live a little bit vicariously through her, but there's something special. I don't know if you want kids, or even if you had a dog before, it's kinda like the same thing. Have you ever trained your dog how to do something? I guess what I'm trying to say is, you take your kid to daycare right? She comes back and she's like, "Hi dad" and normally it would be whatever... but she never said that before, like doing a greeting was something totally foreign. Every time, you never know what she's going to say or do, so you really appreciate that cause like.... that’s her! And she's growing, she's learning and she's becoming so much better. That to me, is my greatest accomplishment; everything she does, I'm proud of, and it's mine!

<div class="profile_extra1">
  <img src="{{ page.images }}11.jpg" alt="sexy guy">
</div>

<h3 class="question">What is your most treasured memory?</h3>

Uhmm, hmmm... I think another moment probably with Zo. When your kid is born: typically they want milk, diaper change, blah-blah-blah, and I still wasn't with it. When she was born, I wasn't really the person that I am now. For the first year, I would say that we weren't super close because she always wanted to be with her mom. I mean like I got boobies, but I don't got milk <i>(grabs his boobies)</i>. So it’s like, you kinda feel useless... she would let me rock her to sleep and everything, but beyond that, she wanted her mom more than me. And so the most heartwarming moment was probably the time where uhhh... She's a bit over one, mom's at work... she had to go back to work and so because of that, Zoe and I had more time to bond—I had no choice now but to change her diapers and clean her poo. You don't have a choice anymore, you have to do it. So at that point, being more involved, moreso than I was before, and taking care of her... she's all, "Daddy, I want daddy," that was the first time she ever did that, it was very... vindicating. I was like, "Awwwwwww," that’s when we started to really bond. Like obviously you always love your kid no matter what, but it finally felt mutual. It was a rockstar moment.

<h3 class="question">What was your most terrible memory?</h3>

Yeah so probably would've been finding out about about pregnancy—it's something that I don't forget. Maybe moreso through March 2015, basically through January, March, April and May. Yeah it would've been 2015 in March... like it's ingrained in my head because she was throwing up and all the signs were all, "Oh maybe she's sick." It's like, "No way," right? So then I went to my class, took a selfie with the boys, whatever. I remember that one day really well and it just... now I'm thinking like, "Man this is a fork in the road: either my life is going to keep going on the path that's been going my entire life... avoiding issues and nurturing, or it's going to go this other path right? So what ended up happening was we went to... did you ever go to the Dundas Square? So I'm being very descriptive of this, basically we went into the shoppers below AMC, grabbed like a couple of tests because you can never know and right there it's like a Five Guys. So I gave her the pregnancy test and told her to use the bathroom over there, or over there. She comes out and she starts crying so you have to be like... were these tears of joy or tears of "not good?" We didn't even eat that night; we got the food before because we were going to celebrate the "good news". But we went back to my place, which was a shitty area and then at that point... it was one of the hardest things because she was very Christian. Like she thought she could never get pregnant blah-blah-blah, it was very out of left field and she had this whole thing about it at the time. We were thinking adoption or something and she was like, "No I want to keep it," and so then you kind of have this realization that you're powerless... completely.

<div class="quote to-fade-up">
  <h2>"{{ page.quote3 }}"</h2>
</div>

Like when I had my accident it was fine; I wasn't hurt he wasn't hurt, my parents could deal with it... get me a lawyer something and then "boom," I didn't even need to go to court and I was let off no hassle right? It wasn’t even my fault in the end. In this case, there was nothing anyone could do besides her, so you feel totally powerless and that was sort of a feeling that you never want to feel. I think I just sat in the bathtub... cold water, nothing. I just started crying and reflecting on how I fucked up. I told my friends, the people that I surrounded myself with; the people that I don't consider friends really now... They were saying things like, "Ohh your life's over because if you split up she's on child support for forever, or you stay there with her and you can never be happy." That was the part of my friends circle that kind of fed into this negativity. I then realized there were people I could really account for: there were people that were like, "No it's fine. Don’t worry, you're not 16 and pregnant like teen mom, you're 20, you're whatever, you’re almost finished your University degree, you can get a job pretty easily and you'll be fine." Having those kind of people around... the kind of showed me the light a little bit really helped me out. Yeah because I think the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do was... telling my mom wasn't super bad... though it was a bad idea to tell her as she was driving. Having to tell my dad was really hard: my mom said, "If you tell your dad make sure it's been three months," cause like a Jewish thing you don't want to... curse the pregnancy or whatever. He then asked the two A's, like abortion or adoption? It's like, "Whoa dad I have no control over it," so it's one of those things where you kind of support whatever the decision is, and I'm really happy with the decision that we went with. So I spent the entire day with him playing badminton, we did exercise, went out to eat, blah-blah-blah and the whole day I'm thinking like, "I gotta tell him." It's like the thing in your throat and you just can’t. So then we're just going for a walk... walking my dog with him and I was like, "Hey dad, she's pregnant," and then he's says, "Oh, good luck." Like that was his response, he said, "I have 40 years of life experience on you if you need anything." That's the kind of parents I have; other parents would've kicked their kids out of the house. So I moved back home: I didn't want to have that living expense. Yeah so I think that in the long run that's where my environment really gives me opportunities to cultivate myself, whereas I might not have been as fortunate with other parents. It was definitely the hardest time in my life, but I felt so much stronger after that and I'm so thankful that things went the way they did.

<h3 class="question">What roles do love and affection play in your life?</h3>

I think that it's interesting because, I feel like when you're not a relationship or anything... the thing with time... with me going back to education is that you have so much time to yourself. So even before the classes you can go exercise, you can go at all this coding and play games, you can do whatever—hang with your buddies. You have all this freedom and you can be your best possible self. Like I think fitness wise I was 170, my goal is 165, I prefer to be lean than bulky but fuck... donuts taste good. But one the thing is, is that you're working out; you're doing all these things and going through all these experiences, but you have no one to necessarily share it with, and that's where love and affection come into play. I felt like it wasn't fulfilling without it and that's when Michelle came in and it's like... obviously I gained some weight but at the end of day, I'm a lot happier. I would feel kind of bored you know? You can watch only so many YouTube videos. Yeah, it just felt... I felt too "productive" and not enough like, "Okay what else can I do?"

<div class="profile_extra1">
  <img src="{{ page.images }}8.jpg" alt="sexy guy">
</div>

<h3 class="question">And how close and warm are you to your family?</h3>

That's kind of hard to say, I think we're close in the sense that I've always been kind of private, except for these interviews (laughs). I don't like to necessary air my laundry with anyone: I kind of pent things up because as a kid, if I told my dad something he would flip out because he had a very short temper. Not that he like hit me... not like that's a thing, but he was a screamer and my mom... I was closer with my mom because if you have to choose between two evils—like getting yelled at or not getting yelled at. So my mom and I are pretty close so I guess. Like in terms of girls maybe talk with my close friends about them but that was it. So I would say we are close and the sense of I'll vent to them or whatever and they can talk about their day with me, but like the close things to me I would probably keep to myself. Having Zoe kind of put sort of a little bit of a wall up especially between my sister and I. We were never really close to begin with, but we would be cordial. We talk, but now it's sort of just like when I told her about Zoe: she was very joking, that was her response. To be fair, I texted her being like, "You're an aunt," so that was sort of that so my relationship with my sister. We were more like acquaintances but at the same time, she did things that inconvenienced me. So she kind of had this project where she would rearrange Zoe's room and that's really frustrating because when you're a parent and your kid takes a shit... you need to know where her diapers are, need to know where her baby bottle is. To do all that stuff and when someone cleans the room, you don't know where any of that is. It's very in the heat of the moment, was really pissed off. So I say that we were never really close to begin with, but after Zoe... if she moves out I'm probably not going to talk her. Grandparents are pretty good, my bubbe, (which is the Yiddish word for grandma on my mom's side, the more Jewy side), they use to message me... like call me rather, everyday after school. I guess it kinda plays in the time that you get, where you should appreciate the times they call even though you are annoyed as a teenager, because there's going to be a time where they aren't there to call. I'd say we're somewhat close, somewhat warm, but the close things I don't really talk to them about.

<h3 class="question">Help me complete this sentence, "I wish I had someone whom I could share..."</h3>

I wish I could share my JavaScript cause I can't fucking do this. I think it's, uhhhh, I think that what was cool was that... when I was growing up, you ever go on Stickpage? it was like a stick animation, kind of like Newgrounds?

<h3 class="question">Like Xiao Xiao?</h3>

Yeah like that dude! So I was on that right? That was back when MSN was still a thing. So I had this buddy, not even a buddy yet, but I was into animation at that point. That’s how I knew about flash and stuff, we used to do flash all the time like stick fights, put them on Newgrounds. Really good buddies. So basically, for content animation I was a really big fan of this one guy Steven Fitzpatrick, his name was Fitzy. He did like a Xiao Xiao type video, and it was very cool. So I added him on MSN and we started talking. What was cool about us was that he lived in England, we had no mutual friends, and this was before Facebook. So it was someone that you could just talk to, for hours... like a penpal you could talk about anything. Something like when you’re with a girl or something, you can't say anything on your mind really... theres still a filter no matter what. If you know somebody, there's still a filter, you can't go off the key here, I dunno if that’s a word, but like... just go rip into something or someone because you still want to be mindful of their feelings. But when you’re talking to penpals, you’re sort of shaping your world and they're getting your perspective on things, right? They have their commentary on that, and that's something that I don't have. That would be pretty cool, to have that penpal relationship going on again. But then again, I don't have the time for it, but it was cool to get another set of eyes on things, it's like the sanity check: "Am I crazy? Or would you have done the same thing?"

<h3 class="question">What do you like most about yourself?</h3>

I think it's like this sort of pro and con. What I like about myself is... I have this painful self-awarenesss, where I’m always thinking about how I'm coming up, how I'm making other people feel, and its like... almost crippling at times. At my coding bootcamp’s final project showcase, how should I approach someone? Should I let them go? You overthink it, but at the same time, never feeling like you’re good enough keeps me coding everyday. It's this thing where, it's a motivator... it also, you’re chasing your own tail. You want to feel like you’re good enough, but you also don't wanna feel satisfied, cause then you plateau... and so that’s something that I like the most about myself, also I feel like I try not to burp out loud in restaurants and that sort of thing, and like, yeah.

<h3 class="question">Can you share an embarrassing story?</h3>

 So I was at Screamers (haunted houses) and they had this sort of... this ride. It was one of those things like The Cyclone at Wonderland where they spin you and whatever... it was Screamers so we're talking shit quality. So I was there with my girlfriend at the time and her family and friends. We're all sitting in this thing, and the person beside me is sort of... large and in charge—a little thick. Anyways, what happened was... the ride goes, everyones fine and you know I don't really even like rides, but it's fine. You’d think something funny happens on the ride, but nooo, it happens afterwards <i>(smiles handsomely)</i>. So the way you sit in the seat... let me paint a picture for you: think of it almost like... you have a little thing in your legs, I want to say something like a booster seat that kids have. So it's here wrapped around sort of your legs a little bit, and the way you get out of the chair is: you push that down, and you hop off the chair, like a bunny hop, right? So what ended up happening was I was pushing down on my seat, getting up... then the thick... person, is standing up at the same time. The thing is that when they got up, the WHOLE ride shot up, and I, uh... the little booster thing went right into my nuts. So I ended up going "boom," and I face planted... and now everyones laughing at me. I was in so much pain... it was brutal, and it was a time. But yeah... that was the most embarrassing thing. I kinda lost my breath, it was kind of a winded thing, like man I just got a vasectomy basically... it was a wild one.

<h3 class="question">What, if anything is too serious to joke about?</h3>

I think, now that I have a kid... I think that I'm not into the pro-life, pro-choice debate. I use to be a lot more reserved about it but it's hard to... I find that I’ve been on both sides of it now. So it's one of those things where it’s not my place to judge, it's not my body, not my choice. My girlfriend has a friend that had like 3 abortions, and it just... again it's your choice, your everything but like... you start thinking things like, "That could have been Zoe." And so again, I have no quarrel with people that decide to have abortions... I don't want to think less of the person because of it, but for me it’s something that makes me uncomfortable because obviously I have my opinion on it, I think it’s pretty obvious how I feel about it. Even though I don't want to think anything of the person, you do sort of feel like... I like them a little less? You don't want to feel that way but you can't help it.

<h3 class="question">If you were to die this evening, with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you regret not having told someone?</h3>

<div class="quote to-fade-up">
  <h2>"{{ page.quote4 }}"</h2>
</div>

I don't think I show enough appreciation for my parents, or for everyone. In a sense, I try to be pretty stoic at times. It's easy to be laughing, make jokes and be happy, it's harder to be heavy hitting with emotions. But I regret not being, "Hey dad I love you, hey mom I love you," because when my grandpa died on my mom’s side... like he called all the grandchildren into the room and say good bye. At that point, he just wanted to talk to someone or whatever, cause like... kind of waiting to go. My regret then: you don't know what to tell somebody that knows they're gonna die. You try to have a normal conversation, or you say things that's like, basically their eulogy for them. So at the time, I decided to do a basic conversation like, "How bout them Blue Jays?" and, "I have this cool business idea". And he's kinda funny at the time, cause he's like, "Next," he's bored of the conversation, so... I kind of regret not saying, "Hey I appreciate everything you’ve done for me... just so you know." Giving him that reassurance, I regret not doing that, and I don't want to regret doing that with other people. I appreciate you Danny.

<h3 class="question">Your house, containing everything that you own catches fire, after saving loved ones and pets, you have time to make a final dash to save one item, what would that be?</h3>

Probably my laptop cause theres so much porn in it and I don't want to download it again.

<h3 class="question">Now of all the people in your family, whose death would you find most disturbing?</h3>

The funny thing about death, is that it’s interesting how life kind of goes on. With the grandparents, you mourn and then life goes on. You don't get the calls anymore, it's just... you adapt. Having a dog die; I remember for the first year or two years of my dog being put down, cause she was in so much pain. Anytime I heard keys jingling, I thought it was my dog and I would go look for her, which sounds kind of weird because in that moment you’re like... in this weird dream fantasy... what if THAT was the dream, and she's actually still here? So I think my mom or dad would be pretty brutal, because they're such a constant in my life... almost like the compass of guidance, even though I don't always abide by it. I don't even wanna talk about Zo because... yeah, that would be my biggest fear, if anything ever happened to her.

<h3 class="question">So, last question; share a personal problem that you’re going through right now, and how you plan on remedying that</h3>

Ouuu, thats toasty. I don't know if I have anything super super deep going on. I’ve got my fair share of problems that anyone else has, right? I think just job hunting is probably just my biggest problem: I have so much anxiety about finding a job, because it’s sorta weird... it feels like I'm in this vacuum, or this void. You’re trying to reach out, you feel almost hopeless, maybe they'll get back, maybe they won't... am I really that good of a coder? Did I waste my time and money doing this? But I know I wasn't happy where I was before, so part of the solution is gonna be... see I know Sasha (career coach) knows everything: you have to go to meet-ups, you have to go for coffees, you gotta add people on LinkedIn and connect with them that way. I know that I’ve been shooting myself in the foot because I’ve been sticking within my comfort zone, I’ve been messaging people I already know, I haven't been trying to make new contacts, I’ve been applying to jobs on job postings, on websites, and getting internal referrals from people I know. I haven't been going to meet-ups right? I've had some success, but I haven't had a job. So you can say you’ve taken steps, but you haven't been successful in my eyes. So I thought I’d give it a month and do it my way, if it didn't work, I'd try it her way. So that’s sorta my thing, I needed to... sort of going back to my parents not letting me make my mistakes and be wrong. I need to be wrong in order to see that I was wrong, and then listen to someone sometimes. I think I'm better at it now than I was before. Even maybe a year ago, I didn't need you to prove anything for me to listen to you, but in this case, I just felt like I felt super confident in my abilities to find something. It's hard, but I think I have a good idea of what to do. It's just that, it's hard to go about doing that: to commit, go downtown or something... I feel exhausted after, but I’ve got this.
