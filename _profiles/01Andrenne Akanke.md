<h1 class="to-fade-up">So as you know...</h1>

My name is Andrenne, artist name Andrenne. I'm also known as Drena, Drena the runway diva, or... yeah!
I’m a visual artist, arts educator, entertainer, storyteller and model. I grew up in Montego Bay Jamaica. I came here with my family... all my other family came before me, but I came over with my brother. I came back in 2001 and lived in Scarborough, I grew up there. In terms of my artistry and what inspired me to be an artist... when I was 5 years old, my cousin... I found my cousin painting; a deaf painter in Jamaica. I couldn't communicate with him or anything like that, but I was like, “Why?” you know? I went to school close by him. So whenever there were like lunch breaks or stuff like that, I would run over to see what he was doing... how far he progressed with his painting and I just remember sitting by his easel and being amazed, I wanted to learn how to paint portraits like this.

So anyways years later, fast-forward and immigrated to Canada right? Scarborough. Then I had my first official art class with actual art teachers, just... focused. Before it was kinda like, I just would make things out of whatever I found, you know? Like on the floor, garbage or anything pretty much, just came up with like sculptures or just things like that. But I wanted to paint, I wanted to be a painter, I had that dream. So I moved here and had my first art class in grade 7.

<h3 class="question">So it seems like you already knew where you wanted to go? In grade 7?</h3>

Ohh, I knew what I loved! They had markers, they had crayons, they had the whole sh’bang, but I don't think they had paint or anything like that. So I still wasn't doing the painting, but I was being creative, I was using colors. That was my main love, right?

And then you know... went to high school. I was not tied down by doing art class and things like that, because I felt I was too cool; my friends weren't into that, but I still tried to remain creative. It was after school really, after high school where art really started to come in for me. I was telling the story of this artist friend of mine who I grew up with. She gave me an art book and it was like my FIRST book; a drawing fundamentals book. It was one of the first gifts that I ever received where I felt like somebody really thought about what I was into. I felt obligated to read this book obviously... I was big on all of that, but I was really excited because it was a book about art and how I could improve myself as an artist, and I would read it back to back, to back to back. They had exercises in it, and I would copy every single thing in that book until I got better and I noticed my drawing skills was on another level. Like I was on the subway, like sketching and doodling all the time. You know how the bus shakes and train moves and all of that?

<h3 class="question">Yeah! You kinda have to move with it.</h3>

Ohh I was on it, I was on it! I even thought about becoming a tattoo artist at one point because my motors skills was just SO on point. That I was like, “Yo I could do this,” though I didn't. It was like, “Oh well you gotta have tattoos to be a tattoo artist," is what people kept saying right? So I was like “Okay whatever,” but at least I tried a bunch of things, right?

I taught art for quite some time, like for a long time I taught kids; through this organization, like an arts organization. I worked with children, youth and peers and everybody else, right? And as I would teach a kid how to develop themselves, I would go home and still have my studio. I still had my studio where I was still working and keeping that going, cause what usually happens with art teachers: like they end up stopping, doing their own practises for whatever reason, I don't know... maybe it gets too much, right? But for me... I couldn’t stay away from art.

It's like I HAVE to create... like I can’t see myself NOT creating; I’ve always been a creative. I’ve always been the type of person where she's like, “Oh I can't afford it? Okay cool, well I’m going to use... make something out of this,” and then it turns to be something that people are like, “Oh wooow, what is that!?” Something that people just have never seen before, or something that people want more of, right? That gave me confidence. So when I had tools that were actual tools that came from an art store, an actual paint palette, it's like, “Okay,” it was time for me to master that as well and take it to the next level.

<div class="profile_extra1">
  <img src="{{ page.images }}6.jpg" alt="sexy girl">
</div>

<h3 class="question">From teaching children, I remember you told me at one point you were an art curator, you helped put people on art shows, how did that come to be?</h3>

I have a lot of experience putting shows together. I volunteered with galleries to put their shows on, and I was young, sooo... <i>(laughs)</i> I was young, so it didn't really.... I don't know they gave me opportunities to put my work too. They’d be like, “Ohh you can put your work in the show? like you're helping, you can sell it,” and that was my introduction to professional art gallery shows. Yeah... did that for a few years.

<h3 class="question">What compelled you to finally start working on your art show "Kuhlad Mind?". What was the spark or moment where you were like “I need to do this”?</h3>

For the last couple years, I was thinking about doing my show, because I realized... I didn’t have my own show! I think I shy'd away every time I had the opportunity to do something for me. I would always do something on a larger scale and involve as many people, just because I know a lot of people that do these things, you know? In the art industry there are artists, and I feel like why not just share all that? "You do this, you do that and I do this, lets do something together!" That was very much a leader in making sure that there were I guess... platforms for myself and other youths. So I did that, but then I realized, “Omgosh,” I still have not done something for ME, you know what I mean? Celebrating my work. So I said, “Okay,” I'm going to do this show because I need it... for me, right? Not just for me, but its still for everyone right? But I need, I NEED a room filled with art that was made by myself or... you know? Came from my own like... how can I transform this paint, make it my own and how can I handle that?

<h3 class="question">So being who you are, doing what you do, what're some problems that you deal with that other people might not experience? What are some issues or hustles that you had to put yourself through?</h3>

<div class="quote to-fade-up">
  <h2>"{{ page.quote1 }}"</h2>
</div>

Well you have me being female, right? Uhh... there are challenges that come with that, and there are also challenges that comes with me being a female—me being a black female, me being... lets see... growing up in what one would call an undisturbed, underprivileged community is what they would call it. So basically, what one would call the ghetto. Like, there’s so many barriers that you face as an individual with all of that, right? So many loopholes, so many... but for me it always motivated me to go harder because I feel like I deserve the things that make me... ME, and I embrace that. Embracing that gives me confidence and it also sets me apart. Cause what is considered ghetto to me is considered magic, it's considered beautiful, it's considered to be one of a kind. So, you have some people that will see it on the flip side like it's a downer and you have some people that's just like, “Naw.” It's something that makes me shine, everything like that makes it so great and magical, and something to celebrate, not something to hold me back... or stay away from. Then you still run across people who're always gonna... you know hold you down. But its too late for me, like I’ve already fallen in love with ME, I've already fallen in love with the journey.

<h3 class="question">So now that you are where you are, what are some tips or things that you did that you would like pass on and share?</h3>

I feel like I’ve always been the same person, that's one thing. In high school I definitely was on the side of the fence that was like... I had to work my way into being, “cool,” I had to work my way into being respected, I had to work for that. And that comes with: not so much work with other people, but more so work on yourself. So when somebody believes you, or somebody teases you, or somebody puts you down... you really go home and you really let those messages eat you away and tear you down. Or you do the work on yourself and realize that, “Naw thats not true,” and there's something special about me and I'm going to share that with the world. That's what you’re gonna see, that confidence. And people have no choice but to love it and accept it and thats ALL they see... I mean, people see what you want them to see, right?

So something I share with people is to basically turn water into wine <i>(laughs)</i>, you know what I mean? With that pain, with that thing... that very thing that is either put down, or forbidden, or not celebrated by other people is the very thing that makes you unique, right? So I would say to spend time with that thing and to examine that thing. And if you spend enough time with it, you realize that it’s something to love and to show, as opposed to something to be insecure about, or let stop you.

<div class="profile_extra1">
  <img src="{{ page.images }}3.jpg" alt="sexy guy">
</div>

<h3 class="question">Would you like to famous and in what way?</h3>

<i>(laughs)</i> I don't know what do you mean? What do you mean by fame though?

<h3 class="question">Well what would you consider as fame?</h3>

Would I want to be famous? I dunno what that means!

<h3 class="question">Would you want to be at a point where when you’re walking down the street, people would recognize who you are?</h3>

Uhmmm it depends... for what, right? What do they want to recognize me for? Something detrimental or great? Of course respect is always great, I would love to meet as many people as I can and I would love for my art as well as my story, as well as the WHOLE VIBE OF ME, to reach as many people because I feel like it is something that people SHOULD experience. Especially people who need it, right? So that’s what matters to me, but if that’s fame then that's fame.I want people to be wearing my stuff, I want people to have my art in their spaces, but not just to just put it out, no. They do it because it's like, they really connect with it, they really connect with me, they really connect with my story, you know what I mean?

<h3 class="question">So given a choice of anyone in the world, dead or alive, who would you invite to a dinner party?</h3>

Who would I invite to a dinner party? Dead or alive.... who would I? Hooold on... my SHADOW! Can I say that?

<h3 class="question">Of course!</h3>

I say that because we spend so much time running from ourselves right? Just hating ourselves when you look at shit at the end of the day. If we all look for someone to blame for our shit, we go around sometimes looking for that person to blame for all the wrongs, or that person to thank for all the rights. But either way, at the end of the day, it all comes down to YOU. So I'm saying, all of that stuff that I tried to run away from, or shy away from... myself. I would sit down with myself, my shadow and have a heart-to-heart. It's true when you think about it because nobody is more important than YOU.

<h3 class="question">What would constitute a perfect day for you, from the moment you wake up, to when you go to bed?</h3>

<div class="quote to-fade-up">
  <h2>"{{ page.quote2 }}"</h2>
</div>

The perfect day? That’s so great. For me... it's to... yeah, be in tune that whole day actually. Throughout the day because it's hard to stay... so centered, right? But to always be in a place where I can see everyone as a reflection of me. Where we're not just connected, where it looks very, you know like “ohh that looks negative” or “that looks bad”. When you see yourself, you’re more compassionate, you’re more understanding to whatever you’re seeing. So a day for me, regardless of where I'm at, regardless of what it looks like... of perfection... is just being, remaining centered—remaining in tune. I have the best days, and I used to think it was, “Ohh I want a vacation, that’d be great,” or, “Ohh I wish I had all this money it's great.” Like I remember the time I was late for work and it was still a really good day... it was like, “Nah,” I think it was something about being aligned and you know... making something out of nothing!

<h3 class="question">When was the last time that you sang to yourself and what song was it?</h3>

Ha! That I sang to myself? uhmmm... wow... probably last night, but I can't recall what song it was. Showering? A shower singer, yeah.

<h3 class="question">For what in life are you most grateful for?</h3>

I'm grateful for... I'm grateful for people. People that I can connect with and learn from and build with, like I appreciate that—just connections. Some people are complete opposite; they don't want anything to do with people right? Yeah for me, I try to learn something from everyone... like where would I be without people? Like I mean I sure it'll be okay too, but even if not people... I also consider all things, all living things... like living and teaching right?

<div class="profile_double">
  <img src="{{ page.images }}2.jpg" alt="sexy girl">
  <img src="{{ page.images }}.jpg" alt="sexy girl">
</div>


<h3 class="question">If you change anything in how you were raised or how you grew up, how would you change it?</h3>

If I could change anything... hmm... how I was raised... hmmm... OH hmm, I would chaaange... I mean, <i>(laughs)</i> okay, I can go the cliché way, and be like, “I wouldn't change a thing cause I wouldn't be who I am today.” But if I really had to say something it would be that... people around me tend to be more fearful and guarded. So when you are raised by people who are fearful and guarded (not everybody), but the people who were directly like, “Ohh you can't come here because of dah-duh-dah-duh-dah,” it's just like I wanted to go out, I wanted to see the world. I was really held back from doing that. So thats one thing, you know?

<h3 class="question">So you think you would gotten to where you are now quicker?</h3>

I dunno about that, I feel like we are where we are and thats just what it is! But if I had to say something it’s just... yeah I’ve always been an explorer and I’ve always liked that and I think... <i>(laughs)</i>. I mean I get the whole “NO, don't go over there, NO dah-duh-dah-duh-dah..." I don't even know Jamaica as much as I would like to; I didn't really get to travel, go places. Even my family, they make fun of me because of that, “You don't know anywhere in Jamaica, you don't know anything!” They're kinda right, yeah... it was very different when I came here though.

<h3 class="question">Do you have plans of going back?</h3>

Yeah I’ve visited and I plan to in the future, but there are other places that I’d like to see as well.

<h3 class="question">Is there something that you've dreamed of doing for a long time?</h3>

Coming to Canada, for a VERY long time, since I was I kid!

YEEEAAAH man, that was the dream, that was the focus and I held on to that... my mom was here right? So she would tell me of the life here and I would be like, “WOOOW!” <i>(laughs)</i> Mad malls, shopping, this, that, I totally was like “OKAY,” it's like I saw the world before I even got here... so when I got here, it was really was like, "Wow...” like actually seeing it, you know?

<h3 class="question">Whats the greatest accomplishment so far in your life?</h3>

Greatest accomplishment? <i>(laughs)</i> For me, I know this is gonna sound... off, yeah. But I think I’ve really, really... mastered... forgiveness. That is my biggest accomplishment, and that is something that I did for me at a very early age. And I say that because that is the most important thing I think... is to be able to forgive and also to accept, you know? Just... yeah!

<h3 class="question">Wow, that's a good insight, because I was expecting the answer to be something else, like your art show!</h3>

<div class="quote to-fade-up">
  <h2>"{{ page.quote3 }}"</h2>
</div>

No no, no-no-no! These things, these things are very ahh... I think I wouldn't say it’s easy to do: it's not easy to do, right? But when you wanna talk about REAL HARD SHIT to do, it’s really forgiving people; I realize people have a hard time doing that. I’m like, “Wow people have a hard time letting go of things like that....” Depending on what it is, but you do it for yourself, not for everybody, right? Even when you tell them that you forgive them, you don't necessarily do it for them, it's for YOU... in order for you to evolve and to just... you know... to transcend.

<h3 class="question">What do you value most in your friendships? Can you describe a best friend?</h3>

Ohh what do I value the most? In a friendship? Mmm <i>(thinks intensely)</i>... most.. I'm gonna say loyalty: loyalty is real, it's real big. Loyalty is a big big thing... and describe a best friend? <i>(laughs)</i> No, I don't... I don't really, I don't have best friends <i>(laughs)</i>. I don't believe in those things, but I think loyalty is important and uhh.... okay I shouldn't say I don't have a best friend, I dunno what I'm saying, like a particular person, individual? I don't give too many people THAT title, because <i>(laughs)</i>, that’s setting yourself up you know?

<div class="profile_extra1">
  <img src="{{ page.images }}8.jpg" alt="sexy girl">
</div>

<h3 class="question">What is your most treasured memory?</h3>

Most treasured memory? Yo I think my most treasured memory are memories of me just walking around in Jamaica, just barefooted, climbing trees... you know? Doing shit that people should be doing: just chillin', eating mangoes, building forts... yeah, I had just a very interesting childhood. Me and my cousins, we would take off and go in the bush. We call it gully, right? Some people call it, “Jungle, forest... GULLY.” We’d go into the gully and we would spend the WHOLE. DAY. I mean, like at the time it was still okay to do that sort of thing, so parents weren’t like, “Omgsh, where did they go?” Nah, we would travel FAR PLACES, and we would build tents, we would go fishing. I mean we were kids, OUR ideas of “dollhouse” was like a whole day thing. We would fish and cook, actually cook... like build fires. Those were some great memories... yeah it was amazing. And I'm just like... it's such a different life now, right? Even back home now, people aren’t living like that anymore. That's so... I got to experience that, that was our childhood.

<h3 class="question">Whats your most terrible memory?</h3>

Terrible? <i>(laughs)</i> The hardest one required learning, like forgiveness and all of those things, right? But uhmmm... I think one of the hardest things was like being teased for being a girl, or being black or for having hair texture like I do. I think that was one of the hardest things because I partially hated on myself for a second... I felt like, “Wow like, they're right!” But it wasn't for a long time, it didn't mold me into... I mean you have adults that still go around with stories on self hate and its like, “Damnnn, you're still on that?” So it's a real thing and I'm glad that did that work.

<h3 class="question">How close and warm are you with your family?</h3>

Ohh! We're all close, yeah my family. I used to think we weren't, but... yeah! People would be like, “Wow! You and your family, you guys are so close.” We laugh, we cry, we go through things. What I appreciate most about my family: whatever we go through, we go through together. So if it's a moment of happiness, a moment of depression, a moment of struggle, we’re in it together and we understand that we're going to go THROUGH it together. I LOVE when families are like that.

<h3 class="question">What roles do love and affection play in your life?</h3>

Mmm... love and affection in my life. Okay, so... love? and affection... I'm very affectionate, I'm very expressive. It's like I try my best when it comes to love... I love HARD. When it comes to hate: I'm human <i>(laughs)</i>. I'm human, right? So I'm not perfect. This idea of love, like whatever it is... it's a feeling... definitely. And I enjoy that, I enjoy that with myself, a lot... a lot. Because you can show that same affection and love to people and they don't get it, like they don't get it or they’re offended by it, or they just don't accept it... they don't want it. So I’ve spent a lot of time practising love and affection with self. And I really ship that and project that with people, just the way that I want to be treated, the way that I want to be told, the way that I want to be... valued. I just try my best to... BE that right?

<h3 class="question">Help me complete this sentence “I wish I could have someone whom which I could share... "</h3>

Hmm... shaaare... vibes with! <i>(laughs)</i> Like build with, create with... but then again, I do... I'm not alone in this world, there's always people. I'm saying to end that sentence, I wish I could have someone to vibe with.

<h3 class="question">What do you like most about yourself?</h3>

<div class="quote to-fade-up">
  <h2>"{{ page.quote4 }}"</h2>
</div>

What do I like most about myself? That's kinda hard, I love everything about myself! But MOST... is my self expression, just the way that I express myself is not a particular way: it's through everything that I do, and I’m very unapologetic at that, and I love that. Yeah, not everybody can do something and be okay with it.

It's all about intention, when you’re seated in, you know? Having my intentions are good; my intentions are pure. Even if it comes across as like... yeah, it's just like, "No." Sometimes what you accept how people see things, it's just not... you can’t help that, right? And if you spend a lot of time trying to focus on helping people see YOU, the way you want to be seen... like, sometimes you just get lost in the sauce. Just focus on doing you, you know? Just do it with the intent: good, bad, whatever, do YOU, own it and accept it. It is what it is, be balanced!

<h3 class="question">Can you share an embarrassing story?</h3>

Yes! <i>(laughs)</i> This is one that I like to share, I’ve shared this before. So one time I was making out with this guy... and we were making out in the dark... we turn the light on... his shirt was covered in BROWN makeup... his white shirt. I was wearing foundation and all this shit, and he was like, “OHHH,” his reaction was like, “What the fuck?” Like how do you explain that? I was like, “Ohhhh no...” so embarrassed. I really had to think about... like, "Shit, how much makeup I was wearing?" But it's whatever, it was EMBARRASSING for me, cause guys... they don't think about how we wear makeup, and then decide to put on a fresh white shirt.

<h3 class="question">What, if anything, is too serious to joke about?</h3>

What is too serious to joke about? uhhmm.... disabilities. I don't like that, I don't like that... it's just sometimes people can't really help who they are, and when people make fun of that shit, it's just... it's not far off from making fun of people who look the way that they do. Like you came out of the womb like that, who are you to say that you're better than this person, who are you to say this person is ugly, or this person is, ohh like, “retarded,” those words. I don't like putdowns basically.

<div class="profile_extra1">
  <img src="{{ page.images }}9.jpg" alt="sexy girl">
</div>

<h3 class="question">What is currently creating buzz in your professional fields, what's on the up and up?</h3>

The up and up...? MEEE, MEEE, anything that I dooo! <i>(laughs)</i> I mean people are just excited about... I realized people are just excited about ANYTHING that I do, not just my paintings. And I think that's because... no not even, "I think," I KNOW it's because anything I do, I'm always putting my 100%. So people are like, “Oh you do this too?!” and it's like, "Yeah!" It's all art to me. So everything is all on the up and up, and I think people are just excited about what’s next, what're you doing and cause they know whatever I do is gonna be JUST as powerful.


<h3 class="question">So when people are reading your profile, I kinda want to give a playlist for them to get into your head, any songs they could listen to to get a good idea of what goes on in Andrenne's head?</h3>

<div class="quote to-fade-up">
<h2>"{{ page.quote5 }}"</h2>
</div>

Well nobody can get into my head, really, and I would NOT RECOMMEND ANYBODY to even try to wrap their head around this. Cause you might go nuts! To get on my frequency... I mean, the best way to do that is to: pull out those crayons, pull out those markers, pull out those paints, throw some jazz on and have a vibe! Like you know? Get a canvas, get a piece of paper, and that's the way to MEET me! If you’re on that creative frequency of like, just loving to create and not being fearful of that... because I'm not a fear-based person, right? There's a lot of fear when it comes to creating something: everybody's like, “Ohhh my god it has to be perfect!” and it's like, "Yo, anybody can meet me there," you know what I mean? We can all meet on a vibe, a frequency of creating and loving and enjoying it, enjoying the process, and that’s what it’s about. Even IF you don't like what comes out of it, like, “Ohh this wasn't that great,” thats fine! Thats okay, just enjoy the process!

Sometimes I like the neo-soul vibe, I like to listen to Erykah Badu, Jill Scott, you know? Chronixxx? I switch it up... it depends on the days. I legit, I'm like, “Hmm, today... I feel like listening to some trap.” I listen to everything... I appreciate artists that are telling their stories; I don't care that I can't really relate with that, you know? It's more I'm listening to that person’s story, and if I can really relate from people who come through you know... how do you say... the ghetto, the hood. I can really relate to them, because having being raised through that whole culture, it's kinda like, “Damn,” the desperation for the need to create, to survive, the need to take care of your family, the need to take care of your community, the need to keep giving back, its like, “Damn, I relate to that so much," so even if it's in a hip hop song, a reggae song... I'm just like, “Yeah me too, I get it”.
