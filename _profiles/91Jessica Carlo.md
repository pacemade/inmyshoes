So I grew up, I was born and raised in a city called Sharja, close to Dubai. I came here at the age of seven, my brothers, eight, nine, eleven respectively. My dad ended up in Dubai with banking boom, he answered a job ad in the newspaper for a typist, when typing was an actual job description. There’s a shitton of Indians in Dubai for that reason now. There’s also a wave of Indians coming to Canada, literally following that path. When we came to Canada, we hung around a lot of Gulphies, that’s what we’re called. Gulphies are people who are from the coast, they look like us, they look like they're brown. I think I had a pretty… good, alright childhood for the most part. Growing up was… really stressful after I hit puberty. I would say it kind of takes up a lot of my mental faculties. Not only was I really self-concious, I was a shy-dumpy kid, but not only being self-consioucs and stuff, I was dealing with unhappy parents. Unhappy parents in an unhappy marriage, and due to their christian values, they didn’t separate, they stayed together for the kids. We were <i>so</i> aware, I would tell my mom like, “Why don’t you ever… divorce?”

At the time, I thought everything that my brothers said was gold, they were two years older than me. My older brothers showed me a lot of criticism, judgement and stuff… as a kid. There was not a lot of love, there was no love actually. So basically… i grew up isolated… and lonely. So I was trying to navigate all of my growing pains, plus the extra stuff, plus being mostly financially… in shit? My dad wasn’t great with money. I was really really… a victim of circumstance.

There were times, when I was 21, 22, people were calling attention to my maturity, telling me I was mature for my age. It’s hard to summarize your childhood in one swoop. It was bit miserable, i can admit that now with confidence, because I own my shit. While I was going through the misery, we were doing a really good job pretending that our family was happy. Especially my dad... my dad, til this day (bless his heart), he’s a bit of a puppeteer. We know that he’s not happy, he’s living a life alone in a seniors building and he has no one to really talk to. When my mom goes home, at least she has my brother. Everyone else in my family at least had someone else to go home to. To this day, he kept up this quirk, it’s a personality quirk…. but it’s a mostly quirk of desperation where he wants to present this image where his family is this happy, thriving, fully-adjusted entity, and all going out and making money. Whatever news he could share, he’ll do it. He has really used his kids to fulfill some semblance of a fantasy, because he was never able to live out whatever goals, dreams, aspirations that he had. When he can, we’re here for the pictures, the photo-ops. Then he starts the PR campaign back home like, “look at me and my amazing kids we’re all doing great.”

My birthday was about 2 weeks ago. My dad came through with cake, wine, some pizza or something. All these things that seemed like, “It’s the though that counts.” Came in on a very bad day weather-wise, everyone told him, “Stay your ass home.” I’m really weary of my dad holding up a cellphone camera. When I was a kid he did something fucked up: he basically stole my camera and ran towards the elevator with it (He wasn’t living with us at the time), shared a bunch of pictures against my will to his friends and family. It was photos of my high school graduation, that was when family life was the worst. My brothers had not spoken to each other for a year. My brothers had a falling out and that trickled down to me where me and my brothers wouldn’t speak to each other. As a family, we had gone to my graduation to portray this image that everything was cool and gravy. The pictures displayed that we were all together, but if you look at our faces, no one was smiling… it was all a front. So not only did he steal my photos against my will, I couldn’t actually go to any of these people that I took pictures with and complain about the problems that I was having when I was a kid. I had problems with my father that drove me to seclusion basically, and I couldn’t confide in my own brothers because we didn’t even have a relationship. So everybody was having their own isolated, silo’d, miserable experiences in a bubble. With not one single person to… to share. Our family is very much a family of black sheep: we’re all so different from each other.

Back to the most recent birthday…. basically accepted him for who he is. I’ve taken myself out of his… view, his expectations. I’ve removed myself from the <i>story</i>.I think what was keeping me trapped and depressed was seeing my self as a part of this very bullshit intricate story with my family. It’s like a puppet show, because he wants to exert control. Anyone that gets older, you kinda have to… the way you show love to asian parents is not to give them money or do what they say, it’s to make them feel like they still have control, without actually having control. So I, without knowing it, have gotten very good at making my dad feel like he has that control. I learned from a young age that you have to play the game. I know what people want, and if it really matters to my self-preservation, in order for me to thrive, if it directly impacts my finances, my lifestyle, maybe my own well-being, my youth, ME, I have to actually give people what they want and play the game. So I let my dad believe that he had this kind of fatherly, “head of the household,” role that he never actually had. My brothers didn't respect him, mom, she’s super spiritual, the only reason he’s still in her life is because she allows it. She has forgiven him time and time again, that’s sacrifice. I was just trying to spend my birthday with the people that I actually chose, like chose in the family. He as trying to throw fake birthday parties for me with my “real” family, just for the pictures.

In the apartment complex I lived in…the four members of my family were sitting at the dinner table, waiting for me to come through because it was my birthday. I’m like, “I’m not gonna be there, I’ll with my friends.” Meanwhile, I’m in the basement with my friends, sitting in a busted up car, smoking weed and drinking. I didn’t wanna celebrate my 17th birthday with my family, like wow I went there.

I hadn’t spoken to my dad for a couple of weeks. On my 29th birthday, he came through with a bunch of things that he thought

He needs to be put in his metaphorical place where I don’t give him too much time and attention, cause then it goes to his head. Then he starts to get all uppity like, “I’m your father, I get to do shit that you don’t agree with, I get to send pictures of you to your brothers.” He gets all up in his head because I allowed him in to my life. I LET him be part of my life. When he doesn’t see me for 2 weeks, that’s my say. When he buys me groceries, it’s because I allow him to buy me groceries, when he gives me a ride somewhere, it’s because I’m allowing him to do that. I let him feel like he has a place in my life, and that he plays a role in my life. But i can very quickly just cut that out because he’s done something to fuck it all u. I’ve learned over time that my dad’s just got (what I would say), some narcissistic personality disorder. He doesn’t know what he does and you kinda have to self-differentiate from the family of origin. When he goes through these cycles of abuse, it has noting to do with you, and to think that it has to do with you, is to fall into the trap. If I were to fight with him, and go into that rabbit-hole…. he wins. As I get older, the fights that I have with him are much less intense than the fights that I was having when I was a kid. I’ve learned to kind of just, “Oh, he’s having one of THOSE episodes, where he’s all no his high horse and he gets to puppeteer people.” He’s fucked up a lot of our trust that way.

So that’s my story, my childhood very much revolved around my dad’s dreams for the family, even if those dreams were delusional, and not grounded, and everyone’s truth and reality: we did not make much individualism, or agency…. we didn’t even express ourselves enough to say like, “Fuck it, who cares about what you want? It’s all about us.” We’re his children in a very interesting way, we love him and show him love in a way that he can’t eve-… it’s actually even more loving what we are all doing right now, or at least what I’m doing. I’ve had people visit us from back home, thank god they came through because for the longest time

My family is very much…. an assignment, a spiritual assignment that I've chosen for myself in order to learn the lessons that I need to learn in this lifetime and grow from them. Maybe elevate, or evolve to the next level. In that way, I can be grateful for every single one of them, all of the hurt all of the pain… that’s what makes it worth it.




Being who you are, where you’re at right now, what are some things that you deal with that others might not?

My title on paper is “Manager of Creative and marketing,” I work at a Cannabis tech company, we operate like a startup. It’s about a 17 person strong workforce, and the two people that lead it are father and son. With this and other jobs ii’ve had in the past, I’ve found it hard to navigate being authentic, or being myself. I never thought that I would have to think so hard about this package that I come in. I didn’t think that I would have to be so self-aware in the way that I am now. When I first started working, my first big girl job, was a contract position doing Adobe creative suite, my title was something lik adobe cs6 operator. Basically used abode createive suite for a bunch of rich people . I worked for a commercicla reals estate company, and it was a bunch of people in suits that sat across from emthat made multimillion dollar corporate real estate deals. What they needed was pitch decks and salesbooks and a lot of marketing materials so they could sell multimillion dollar properties. So I was just hired to push pixels around and make pretty things. It was the most stressful point of my young life at some point, I was going to work everyday hating it, and hating myself. I just couldnt figure it out, everything was really really difficult. It got to a point where I was second guessing every movement I was making. That’s when it struck me that I was navigating race and gender in an incredibly white, male focused dominated environment. I just felt really uncomfortable, out of place, I felt like an “other”, all the emotions that came along with that. It felt like I was in back in school and I was trying to be cool and I’m like, “How do i be cool? Why are they so comfortable, why are they so confident and how do I do that?” I thought I had to be like them. If I could go back in time and tell myself, “Stop trying to be cool, they don’t have any expectations from you.”

I don’t feel like I can be 100% myself at the work place, and I’m not sure if most people can be. It’s especially difficult being the trifecta: i’m young, I’m brown and I’m a woman… and I’m in tech. Basically started from the ground up

When I’m feeling at my utmost lowest, it’s because i’m coming out a my day job where people who don’t see for who I really am, and I've been Isupressing who I really am. My 9 to fives are for them, my five to nines and weekends are for me. When I go and take these photos of women, it’s because I’m actually the most visible that I possibly am. Even though I’m showcasing and highlighting other women, I’m also putting myself in this work, anyone who see’s my work see’s me. It’s a great way to offset the feelings of non-visibility in my day job, because I go out there, and I let be people see who I am and they celebrate who I am and they allow me to come through and say, “fuck yeah, take some pictures and be yourself!”




Would you like to be famous? If so in what way, if not, why?

I actually don't want to be famous, I’m scared of… fame. I don’t like fame, I think I would like to be rich and… stealthy walthy. I wanna be one of those people that roll up in a Honda civic… dusty ass shoes…... [laughs]



What would constitute the perfect day?

I’ve been trying to nail this aspect of my life Ill premise this by saying that a good day is a day that fills all four of your buckets from the financial, the emotional, the spiritual and the physical, and I recently got the financial part down pat by securing a job. So now I have to focus on the rest. Ideally, I would wake up and start with a prayer, a spiritual one that shows gratitude and gives thanks for another day... another breath that follows the last one. I don’t do enough of that and it’s… it’s what sets the tone for the entire day. My mom was a very prayerful woman from a catholic context,but she taught me something…if she has an off day and other people sway her from her centre, it’s bcause she didnt spend time in the morning to give thanks and just ground herself in her prayers. You kind of water your garden in that way, right? Everyone has these rituals that water their garden, and if you see yourself as a flower or whaterver, if you think metaphorically, you have to do those things, or it doesn’t feel right.  So wake up, a prayer and maybe shadowbox to some Young MA. You’d have to wear some weighted gloves though.



For what in ife do you feel most grateful for?

It varies day by day, some days I'll say my friends, when I’m really feeling… the bond, the oxytocin. Some days when I’m really <i>alone</i>, I’ll say I value my own company, and I’m really grateful for that. Today I’d say I’m really grateful for the connection I have with friends that are artistically inclined. [thinking] I really… I guess I never valued it before…
Friends with artistic inclinations are valuable to me because I spend a lot of time with people that are very logic driven; I work with a bunch of engineers and hardware folk. Their idea of fun is like… I mean it <i>IS</i> fun. [laughs] We’re trying to plan a Christmas party and they’re factoring overage percentages on alcohol and chicken nuggets… and because of <i>that</i> I couldn’t order balloons. It's like, “Your balloons are too expensive!”
I think friends like you, Andrenne… Hazel’s another. She’s a muse, she’s like an artsy muse. Again, it goes back to being… all my shit is esoteric as fuck, its like a spiritual tribe. It’s like a twin.. you know how there’s twin flames and stuff? I’d just be like., “We’re all on the same wavelength, and I get to be weird as fuck around these people.” You talking about not being weird and people wanting to be normal… I am very much Clark Kent, in the sense that I’m a weird person, wearing a “normal” uniform in my day-to-day. It’s like every day, it’s your alter ego. I get to be an artist everyday, I wont even say that I’m faking it, cause artists, they just get to be whatever the fuck they want.




If you could change anything in how you were raised, or grew up, what would you change?

So I can turn back the hands of tie to have a normal, happy family? A wholeso-… I would love a wholesome childhood. I would love a wholesome, healthy, like phyisically heathy, emotionally healthy, spiritually healthy childhood. That’s all i want.




If you could wake up tomorrow and gain any ability/character trait, what would that be?

Confidence is such a super power. I think that confidence is everything and confidence is the key to success, and I don’t plan on being a realy life Tony Stark or anything, but if I wanted to, I’d need to have his confidence. So i would love to wake up tomorrow with a new story and to rewrite… basically have my story rewritten over night so that it alters my self-image, because I’m spending a much longer time, (longer than my peers), trying to become … how do i say it… I feel like I’m a bit of a late bloomer, in terms of my peers. They spent a lot of time really fully self-assured, or like calidated by their friends or family. I’m still trying to see that out. I’m looking externally for their kind of… that kind of reassurance. If i just wake up tomorrow with a re-wired self-image, I don’t need to do any of that. It kind of takes away from your art, it takes away from your wok, it takes away from all this stuff you’re supposed to do in this lifetime, because you’re spending energy where you shouldn’t be spending. It’s basically like my dad trying to live for other people. I’m not saying I’m living for other people, but I <i>do</i> require a lot of feedback.




If a crystal ball could tell you the truth about yourself, your life your future or anything else, is there something you would want to know?

Yeah, like would I ever settle down and have kids or something. I never cared. I never cared but like… after seeing all these kids at church and their Sunday vests… I’m clearly feeling maternal as fuck, I want all of it. I literally want a school of them, and I wanna just like… [laughs] Just baby all of them. I’m not sure what that was, at all, but my roommates all like, “So now you want one right?” I’m like, “yeah.” I think in the future I would probbaly wanna know… yeah.. would I ever climb my “soulmate” or the person that I’m meant to share my life with. Or if I’m going to live some sort of artist life… or alone. I could be super fulfilled, but would I still be alone?




Is there something that you dreamed of doing for a long time, why haven’t you done it yet?

Ohh uhmmm… I’ve actually wanted to do so many things. I wanted to be a DJ… I still think about it. People have said to me, “You have good taste in music, I could see you being a DJ,” I’m like, “I can see myself being a DJ.” I can see myself quitting a job, like rage-quitting a job because I’d rather DJ or something like that. That’s the coolest fantasy to have. Why I haven’t done this? I told myself that I needed money to be a DJ, so I can buy gear. I told myself that I’m too busy and I have no time. I mean I could do it digitally, I don’t need gear, I could just use some software. So basically I just told myself that I’m too busy and I don’t have time or something. But I really, really dig the fuck out of playing to an audience and controlling the floor and the vibe. I think I said earlier, “Whoever controls the music, controls the people.” [laughs] I think music can run an entire country, cause it gets you by the emotions, right?





What is the greatest achievement in your life?

Yo…like EVERYDAY is a fucking achievement, I’m not suicidal… I’m just saying. I could finally admit to myself, let alone another person… that I’ve had a very challenging time…. coming into my own. There are days where I don’t feel… I’m not feeling it. There’s no connection to another person, I think I go through phases where I just… disconnect or something? So my relation to the people and the world that is my life, it’s like.. it’s kinda weird, I dunno what the word is but… it’s all fragmented. I think it comes from feeling sadness… could be depression, could be isolation or anxiety. So I know that I’m an anxious person and I can admit that. My greatest achievement is just making it, day-by-day. It’s hard to live life, being your own worst critic and enemy, and at the same time, training yourself to be your own best friend and fan. You’re actually doing two streams at the same time, you’re constantly playing both sides. If I wanted to quickly highlight some actual external achievements, my solo trips to Thailand, getting out of my comfort zone, taking those photos, doing that. I took what little savings I had, put it to a first and last month’s rent in a downtown condo, bought some furniture from some chick that was moving out, and turned it into an air bnb and had one of the most interesting years of my life, at the age of 25. I’ve done a lot of cool shit basically, and it’s been very non-mainstream at all, admittedly I would say. I’m not even saying it to brag. [laughs]

What do you value most in your relationships/friendships, could you describe what you want in a best friend?

I value… real, honest, emotional connection and intimacy. It’s hard to get that from friends when my friend are also dealing with their own version of.. self-sabotage and stuff. People who are very much as you say “a perfectionist”, they don’t show their true selves to the world. Only they see it, and what we see is this person that they took a really long time to put forth this person. It’s after beating themself up about it for a little bit. I have friends like that, they’re actually some of the most beautiful people i’ve met because they’ve been through shit. What makes them beautiful is the fact that they’re wiling to express themselves. To share their darkest hours and… some of them deal with addictions, extreme personalities, mood swings and stuff. It’s very interesting to have that kind of perspective in your life, and I think that I haven’t expressed that really well but… I’m thinking in my head that anyone that shows their vulnerable side, is a good litmus test for what makes a good friend.

After vulnerability is honesty, and willing to admit that you fucked up. Because you can have a great, vulnerable relationship, but if you can’t admit that you were a half an hour late—that you fucked up, you’re just an asshole and we can’t be friends. I don’t care how deep the conversations are. [laughs]



What is your most treasured memory?

The snow days when we were younger, that’s when my circle of friends... we were all… I hung out with… My second brother had two friends with younger sisters in my grade. So we kinda rounded out, there’d be three guys, three girls, and the “plus one’s”, like the cousins of so-and-so. We kinda made a circle. When we had snow days, people would either come to my house and play Crazy Taxi, or whatever… we had games going. [smiles] So depending on what year it was… it’d be a different console, different games, something like that. I remember snow days turning into like… this is just a chance for all of us to just game each other. It was cute.


What is your most terrible memory?

Shit… Wow.. too many terrible memories, my life is just a bunch of terrible memories. I think that anytime someone poked fun of me or my parents or something. It kind of triggered some underlying need to change. You know what? I think this memory’s a little clouded, but it’s there. You know when you have a dream, and you kind of don’t remember the dream but you know what happened? You FEEL it, you remember weird parts of it. That’s what this memory was. But I know that it was like.. it shocked me to my core, and it triggered a series of positive changes. It’s because I was so ashamed and… I don't know. It was so much shame, something like that triggered a lot of positive changes.

I would say a lot of my worst memories where I felt bullied, singled out for… the way I looked or something.

I have a good memory to share, I’m gonna share it cause it’s like… venting… and it’s a work thing… and I get to talk about racism. [laughs] This was before my boss and I kind of started to see each other as more like… i dunno… I woudn't say EQUALS, cause he has his moments, but… started to get more on the same page. This was before he respected me or whatever. I went to his office for a one hour thing meeting… didn’t know what it was all about. It was just for me to give him attention and for him to be like, “Look and listen to my funny jokes,” or something. [laughs] He starts some of our meetings with music, because he’s already listening to music in the background, it’s like a conversational piece. And so…. [laughs] One of my friends, when I recounted this story to him, he was laughing, he was like, “Okay Jessica, he’s clearly trying to get on your wavelength by playing Rihanna.” So he’s playing a song, and I’m like, “What is this?” He’s like, “Do you like this song?” and I’m like, “I have no idea what it is!” Then I kinda laughed it off and I didn’t know hat the fuck I was listening to… but I just played along, cause you know… this guy pays my bills. [laughs] You know what I mean? Then he changes the song to… the one with Rihanna, Paul McCartney, Kanye West and he’s like, “How about this?” And I’m like, “Ohhh in between, it’s like black, white, very encompassing.” So while he was playing that, we branched off on this conversation about my dad or something… we were saying… oh yeah, I spoke about how I had to use my dad’s credit card on the Uber ride over cause my credit card got cancelled, or expired. It got experienced, and I never got a new one in the mail. So I was scrambling this morning and I had to call dad and be like, “Dad, I know I’m yay old,… gimme your credit card nuber.” My boss just started laughing and then it branched off to this conversation about like… sometimes your parents have to help you by NOT helping you… which then segway'd to a conversation about culture—culture differences. Great way for two obviously very different people with very different backgrounds to bond. The moment I started talking about how my dad’s culture influences the way he parents me… you know what I get? I get a SHHHHHHHH, like the most condescending thing from like a male, like a ciswhite male. He just like “shh shh shh, listen to this.” He was hushing me, in the middle of my sentence so I could listen to this… bummy-ass country music song. It hadn’t even started by the way, it was just on the intro, where it was literally the guitar. Nothing had started yet and he’s like, “Shhh, do you know this song?” And I’m like, in my head I’m like, “Did you just hush me? So I could listen to this fucking ass song? I’m gonna smack youuuuu.” Like if we were in watching WWF or UFC and the audience members get to fight, I’d choose him. That’s what I wanted. [laughs] But I couldn’t, so I had to listen to him, listen to this intro. When it cues up, the words starts coming in I’m like, “I have no idea who this is…” He’s like, “It’s such a good song, it’s about…” And he tells me about how it’s this deep meaningful track about this guy’s daughters leaving home and like… he wants them to come back and they’re gone of-… It’s white people shit. In my head I’m like, “How the fuck is your story so much more entertaining and intersting than <i>my</i> story?” I actually think the shit that comes out of my mouth is way more fascinating than whatever comes out of your 50 year old white person perspective. His narrative, his story has BEEN said, it’s BEEN done. I’m not learning anything from you, but you are learning plenty of shit from me. you are fascinated by me, you also wanna fuck me. So let’s just call a spade a spade and so… as much of a bad memory that was… it’s like, I’m getting this dished to me for a reason, and I’m learning to eat my humble pie, but also throw it in their face. We’ll see… next thing you know, I’ll be like, “Yo Danny, I’m fired.” [laughs]




If you knew that in one year you would die, is there anything you would change and why?

There’s a good Ted Talk about this, Randy Paush. He’s a professor that did a talk about the last lecture, and he wrote a book called “The las Lecture”. Recently passed away from cancer. It was all about living a life to your fullest or something… as cliche as that sounds. But if I only had one year to live… I’d fucking…. what would I do? I wouldn’t have that much money, so I wouldn't be able to say like, “Fuck you,” to whoever I wanted. But I would love to rage-quit, you know? I would love to… do the DJ thing just once. I would love to throw the biggest birthday party of my life… and actually have people come through cause it’s my last one. I’d probably even have a fake wedding. I’d be like, “Who’s had the biggest crush on me? Yeah I kinda liked you too, let’s have a fake wedding and do some cool shit.” The artist in me would really come out and play. All this stuff is imaginary and make-believe anyway, so let’s go out with a bang—break the matrix for a little bit.




What roles do love and affection play in your life?

Big ones. So much so that I can have entire… I could turn flings into relationships because of how affection “doses” were high. If you’re checking that box, in terms of affection, I could look over a lot of things. love and affection… yeah, I crave, I thrive in those two elements. I think that’s when you’d probably see the best in me. I grew up in that, so I understand how big of a role communicating love and physically displaying affection can really change someone’s disposition on life, their attitude and how they see themselves. It can make an unhealthy child healthy, an unconfident child confident. It’s everything, it’s so much.




How close and warm is your family?

They’re not warm in the mainstream sense, because they’re a bit bizzare. There’s a lot of estrangement and lack of communication. So here’s the thing, there’s this weird triangulation thing happening where we feel like we’re close. We know enough about everybody, because it comes through… My mom, despite not speaking to my dad for the last seven, eight months, will know a lot about him, because <i>I’m</i> the grapevine. My dad, who doesn’t speak to my mom, will know enough about her because of me, because of my brothers. The second brother, who has basically effed off done his own thing for many years… I’ll still hear about him because he’ll call my mom twice a year, and give her just enough details to last. It’ll satisfy, and it’ll last and we’ll milk it. So we know enough about everybody to feel like we have some level of closeness. We have the deets and scoop on everyone, but we don’t have the love, the affection… the stuff that creates a supported family. It’s very surface level. Again, it goes back to my dad… and he’s fine with that, he doesn’t need anything else… he just needs us to play our roles. It furthers his reality. His reality is head of the household, father. So if you play that role, he’s happy. Even if I argue and cuss him out, as long as I say Dad at the end of it all, he’s fine.




Of all the people in your family, whose death would you find most disturbing?

I thought it would be one of my parents, but the inevitable is that they will die from old age. So I’m not gonna say my parents. I feel what would really disturb me is if one of my brothers passed away. If my oldest brother passed away, cause there’s not reason why he would die before my parents. If my mom or dad goes, it’s gonna be for health reasons… i mean ideally. He has his demons, but he generally means well. His demons are: he’s got a temper, he’s got anger issues. He cares the most, but he supresses his emotions the most too. You won’t see him love and affection thing, but you will see him… out of everybody, he’s the one that stuck around. I would say that he’s kind of sacrificing his livelihood and his growth to live in the same living arrangements as my mom, my mom can’t live alone. He’s 30 now, and everyone else knows that the family dynamic is one that holds us back, and keeps us from realizing our fullest potential. So on our our to grow, we’d have to break free and go off on our own. Only check in periodically, but there’s always going to be that one unlucky kid that has to stick around. I feel like it wasn’t an unlucky, “left with the scraps” kind of thing. It was like.. my brother chose, out of all the kids, to stick around with my mom. He’s the oldest son, and despite his personality changes over his teeenage eyars, he’s also the one with the biggest emotional, oldest child crux. He’s got that obligation in him. It’s very traditional, and it’s very respectable. There’s a lot of resentment too because even though he carries out that obligation, he’s got that personality of a ‘westerner,’ lets call it being Canadian. My mom doesn’t understand it, mix that up with the temper and anger issues, and the toxic girlfriend and my mom’s like, “Who are you??” It’s just challenging for everyone to navigate, because we feel bad for him and want the best for him. but because of these strange adflaf and the lack of similarities in values, I can’t connect to my brother and actually tell him, “I actually want so much better for you. I’m the little sister that you basically bullied a lot of my life. Now I’m looking <i>at</i> you like... a parent.” I see my brother, he’s got this kid inside of him, and it needs to be loved, it needs love and affection. I tell my mom, “He just needs love and affection, if you stop criticizing him and if people just stop giving him such a difficult time. I feel like the world is conditioning him to be something he’s not, and it’s getting to him, he internalizes it. That’s why he’s so miserable around everybody, his own mom, and his family. If I could, if I had any super too, going back to that question… it’s to take people’s pain.. and suffering and to turn it into something that they can use to make their lives better. I would apply it to my family first, because they have it the hardest. My brothers have it the hardest. You would’nt think that they’re not capable of dealing with their burdens and challenges, but I think at the core, they haven’t been encouraged to express themselves and they’re suppressing a lot of their needs. Their needs as men and their needs as…. emotional people. A lot of this comes out with these outbursts, and like.. my brother, when he’s the most angriest, keeps talking about how he’s the man of the house and how he’s like…. An my mom would have to refute that and be like, “excuse me?” She’d put him in his place without even planning or wanting to. She’d be like, “But the facts are... I pay this much, and you pay this much. The facts are that I do all this cleaning and you dont do shit. The facts are that I cook for you and you can’t cook.” Those are facts—she’s not trying to bruise his ego. At the core of my brother’s very big armor or shell of maculinity, is this kid that never got the love and affection that he needed, and it stuck with him throughout his adulthood, and he thought that if he kept crystallizing this outward exterior, it would bring the respect that he wants. Respect… and admiration. I think that’s where, “Man of the house, “ statements come from, it’s for us to bow down to this fact, that yes.. maybe he is. If I have to commend him for one thing, it’s not that he’s the man of the house, cause he’s not, he’s not in the traditional way. But he’s made obvious sacrifices, he’s genuinely trying, that’s where I would say like, “if you were aware enough of that, you could come from a place of “listen, maybe im not the man of the house, but I’ve stuck it out while all you other guys, you got the privilige of living your life and I’m here bearing the family “cross”, in a way.” Then I would be like, “you know what? you’re absolutely right.”

I recognize my brother’s contribution to the family. It gets overshadowed by his ego, it gets overshadowed by very petty, masculine, egotistically driven statements. Because you’ve forced people to think that your biggest accomplishment are the fact that you are a man, and something to do with money, something to do with… protection. But really, your biggest contributions are that… you have a heart of gold. I wish you that you had a person that loved and cherished you, rather than this toxic Jamaican girlfriend that has no values (no offence Jamaicans, you’re shady as fuck!). I just wish that the person… I saw him get bullied on the playground, and it was the worst kind of bullying too, when he was a kid. I think that definitely triggered… it was the ripple effect to now. Dudes with chips on their shoulders.. it’s hard to get through to them, they have all this armor on. It would make me sad, cause he does involve himself in very interesting. heartbreaking situations and people. If someone knows their worth, and values themselves, they wouldn’t have bad people in their lives, or bad circumstances. they would just know how to take themselves out of it. I dunno if he’d understand his worth as much, so if he were to die, it would be a young death, unexpected tragic death. It’d be because he didn’t take care of his health, or… he was out, in a rage, driving too fast and it’s a car accident or something.



Help me complete this sentence, “I wish I had someone with whom I could share….”

My life with.



Before meeting you, what is something about you that people should know?

That I am incredibly sensitive, i think so!



What makes you laugh? what do you find humor in?

[laughs] …. stupid… shit. memes, stupid shit and cat videos. Your friends that you party with, I love that stuff. When was the last time I really died of laughter? It’s been a long time… was I drunk? Oh maybe fresh prince reruns, you know what made my die? Someone was expressing their workplace frustrations, and they referenced the Arthur episode, “The big hit” where Arthur punches his sister. So she breaks his toy plane, and he’s like, “I TOLD YOU NOT TO TOUCH IT!” And there’s this frame where he tightens his fist before throwing it.



What do you like the most about yourself?

I like my soft hands. [puts out hands]

You like your soft hands? [feels it out] Oh geez you’re right.

Yes. See I told you! [laughs]



Can you share an embarrassing story?

First thing that came to mind was when I was skipping rope in elementary school and my pants fell all the way down… was <i>clearly</i> not wearing underwear and my friends laughed at me cause they saw my ass. [laughs] But they were so goody-goody that they didn’t know how to tell me. I’m like,  “Bitch, I <i>knew</i> I mooned you!”



When was the last time you cried in front of another person? When was the last time you cried to yourself?

I’ve been more open about crying in front of people lately, because I remember the times where I was very closed off, and outwardly calm and collected, but that was just a front. I was probably the most, the biggest basket case at that time. These days, the last time I cried in front of a person was probably when I teared up in front of my CEO, cause he’s giving me all of this undivided attention. Also just asking me to share things about myself… which meant that he really valued me. to be seen and heard in that way is truly… it’s rare. For me, it’s overwhelming.

The last time I cried to myself was: following the email exchanges, his response back to me, when I was trying to downplay the racism thing and just kind of brush it off. I was like, “Shit, I don’t want to do this, I don’t even want to put the attention there anymore, I want to go back to work.” That’s what me email looked like. His email back was <i>more</i> validating, self-confirming, self-affirming… he put more work in the email than I did. He’s still waiting for my response. [laughs] It’s gonna come back with more thought, I get to take my time I think. The response back to me just… flooded me, it flooded my eyeballs, and I remember walking in a rush to the bathroom, I’m like, “Shit I hope no one’s looking at me…” I just let it all out in the bathroom, I was there for 10 minutes. When i came back, I told everyone I was sick… AND THEY BELIEVED ME. [laughs] The dude that likes me he was like, “Oh fuck, I’m gonna get us some <i>soup</i>.” My office spouse wanted to get me some soup.


What, if anything is too serious to joke about?

See, I’m so sensitive that I feel like I’m not good with joke. I might look like I’m good with jokes, but… yeah… I’m cool with jokes about SJW stuff, all in good fun. I could laugh at jokes about other people’s appearances, but I don't want someone to be like… turn around and dish it out on me. I won’t make fun of so-and-so’s bad hair day, because tomorrow, I’m gonna have a bad hair day, and I don't want them to draw attention to my bd hair day. It’s so petty like that. [laughs] It’s so stupid! I basically got the best advice from a family friend who said, “Now, people know not to joke around with me, they just don’t mess with me, cause I don’t laugh at any of their shit.” That’s the base-line, “don’t joke around with me, I don’t have a sense of humour. Bye.” I like that, I feel like I would get more work done, and I don’t plan on being a joker at work… so I’d like to be like that. My demeanour at work is very “kid sister,”  its good that people can feel comfortable and joke around with me, but I really just think that because I’m not comfortable and I’m fearful at work ( maybe I fear losing my job or something like that ), that I don’t take it that way. I view it as, “You’re saying something about me because this is a reflection of my job performance. I’ll always make it personal; until I get comfortable with them, I’ll be more sensitive than I need to be… or think I am. Yo mama jokes are cool though.

If you were to die this evening with not opportunity to communicate with anybody, what would you regret most not having told someone? Why haven’t you told them yet?

Ohh wow… that I love people. That I love every single person that I have in my family… my friends. It’d be probably be a lot of intimate sharing, stuff that… whatever my ego’s currently stopping me from doing like apologizing, like “Ahh that's dumb, apologizing,” [laughs]


Your house, containing everything you won, catches fire. After saving your loved ones and your pets, you have enough time to make one final dash to save any one item. What would that be, why?

My laptop, it’s my life. My wellbeing and my moneymaker. [smiles] It would be my backpack with <i>both</i> my laptops, can I do that? I assume I have my phone with me too, cause we always have our phones, right?



Can you share a personal problem that you’re currently dealing with right now, and what are the steps that you’re taking to resolve that issue?

I think owning my identity is something that I’m starting to understand. It’s helping me take the reins on my life, because for a long time, I felt like I had to be everything to everybody. So drawing from some of the stories that we’ve talked about, my family, my job and whatever else… I stretch myself a bit too thin, so that other people could feel comfortable around me. I think I learned, from a young age, to not do or say or be anything that could make any other people around me uncomfortable, cause that’s what I thought self-preservation looked like. People controlled my destiny, everybody else has a say in my future but me, that kind of stuff. It’s a lot of fear-based thinking. The CEO was telling me was a shift into abundance, and when you’re a spiritual person, you know that kind of talk, it’s so easy to talk about fear-based, abundance-based, scarcity mindset and abundance mindset, but it’s like, what does that mean, how do you apply that stuff to the real world? The personal thing that I’m going to distill it all into is trying to think from a more, “I already have enough, I am enough.” It’s going to alter my entire future, my story. Also not give a shit.


Any last words of general advice?

I usually like.. I don't know. A rule of thumb is to not… don’t give advice. Cause I dunno, who the fuck gives advice anymore? Unless you’re Donald Trump. [laughs] Always be applying. When you’re at a job, don’t get comfortable: always be applying, always be interviewing. Always see what the market has in store for you, and how you fit the needs of another company thats not your current company. Basically see if there’s demand for your skills so that you can stay confident, and you just know that like… “Yo, this is nothing.” That’s how you shift from fear and scarcity to abundance, you have options. It’s like when you don’t have a lot going for you, you’ll take anybody, right? Like one person. when you it going for you, and you have all these “suitors” that are willing to… you know… you get to choose. But that’s not what I really wanted to say, just filling in the silence. [laughs]

One thing I pinned to my Twitter profile: “People don’t suffer from depression, depression is a symptom. Many depressed people suffer from forsaking their dreams and passions for ideals and beliefs society has afflicted them with. People are not answering their calling, not following their hearts.” Long story short, there’s a Hamlet quote, “To thine own self be true.” I’ve heard it so many times that I consider it synchronistic. CEO’s dad the other day was like, “To thine own self be true.” I’m like, “Why is everyone saying this quote when it’s my favorite one of all time?” These are the people that are going to champion <i>Jess</i>.
