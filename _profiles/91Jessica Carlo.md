<h1 class="intro-word to-fade-up">So...</h1>

<p>I was born and raised in a city called Sharjah, close to Dubai. I came here at the age of seven, my brothers were nine, and eleven. My dad ended up in Dubai with the banking boom, he answered a job ad in the newspaper for a typist—when typing was an actual job description. There’s a tonne of Indians in Dubai for that reason now; there’s also a wave of Indians coming to Canada, literally following that path.  Indian Gulfies by way of the United Arab Emirates. I think I had a pretty... good, alright childhood for the most part. Growing up was really stressful after I hit puberty. Not only was I really self-conscious, I was a awkward-funny-dumpy kid, but I was dealing with unhappy parents. Unhappy parents in an unhappy marriage, and due to their Christian values, they didn’t separate, they stayed together for the kids. We were <i>so</i> aware, I would tell my mom like, “Why don’t you ever... divorce?”</p>

<p>As a family, we had gone to my high school graduation. The pictures displayed that we were all together, but if you look at our faces, no one was smiling. I couldn’t actually go to any of these people that I took pictures with and complain about the problems that I was having when I was a kid. I had problems with my father that drove me to seclusion basically, and I couldn’t confide in my own brothers because I didn’t have a relationship with them. So everybody was having their own isolated, silo’d, experiences. We’re all so different from each other because of our estrangement.</p>

<p>Another time in the apartment complex I lived in... my parents and two brothers were sitting at the dinner table, waiting for me to come through because it was my birthday. I’m like, “I’m not gonna be there, I’ll downstairs with my friends.” I didn’t wanna celebrate my 17th birthday with my family, like <i>wow</i> I went there.</p>

<p>I’ve learned over time that you kinda have to self-differentiate from the <i>family of origin</i>, they call it, even if it hasn’t been healthy all this time. My childhood very much revolved around my dad’s dreams for the family, even if those dreams were not grounded in everyone’s truth. My family is very much a spiritual assignment in order to learn the lessons that I need to learn in this lifetime and grow from them. In that way, I can be grateful for every single one of them, that’s what makes it worth it.</p>

<h3 class="question">What are some things that you experience with that others might not?</h3>

<p>My title on paper is “Manager of Creative and Marketing,” I work at a Cannabis tech company; we’re not a startup but things move fast like one—it’s a 20 person team. I never thought that I would have to think so hard about this "package" that I come in. I didn’t think that I would have to be so self-aware in the way that I am now. When I first started working my first big girl job, it was a contract position doing Adobe creative suite, my title was something like "Adobe CS6 Operator," basically graphic designing for a bunch of rich white men. I worked for a commercial real estate company, and it was a bunch of guys in suits that sat across from me that made corporate real estate deals. What they needed was pitch decks and sales books and a lot of marketing materials so they could sell multimillion dollar properties. So I was just hired to push pixels around and make pretty things. It was the most stressful point of my young life—at some point, I was going to work everyday hating it, and hating myself. I just couldn’t figure it out, everything was really really difficult. It got to a point where I was second guessing every movement I was making.</p>

<p>That’s when it struck me that I was navigating race and gender in an incredibly white, male dominated environment. I just felt really uncomfortable, anxious, I felt like an <i>other</i>, and all the thoughts that came along with that. It felt like I was in back in school and I was trying to be cool, and I’m like, “How do <i>I</i> be cool? Why are they so comfortable? Why are they so confident? and how do I do that?” I thought I had to be like them. If I could go back in time and tell myself, “Stop trying, they don’t have any expectations from you,” I could just lay low and relax.</p>

<p>It’s especially difficult being the trifecta: I’m young, I’m of colour and I’m a woman... and I’m in tech. Basically navigating from the ground up. When I go and take these photos of women, it’s because I’m actually the most visible that I can possibly be doing that kind of work.</p>

<h3 class="question">Would you like to be famous? If so in what way, if not, why?</h3>

<p>I actually don't want to be famous, I’m scared of fame. I don’t like fame, I think I would like to be rich and be... <i>stealthy wealthy</i>. I wanna be one of those rich people that roll up in a Honda Civic with my dusty ass shoes.[laughs]

<h3 class="question">What would constitute the perfect day?</h3>

<p>I’ve been trying to nail this aspect of my life; I’ll premise this by saying that a good day is a day that fills all four of your buckets from the financial, the emotional, the spiritual and the physical. I recently got the financial part down pat by securing a steady job, so now I have to focus on the rest. [laughs] Ideally, I would wake up and start with a prayer of gratitude and gives thanks for another day... another breath that follows the last one. I don’t do enough of that and it’s... it’s what sets the tone for the entire day. My mom was a very prayerful woman from a Catholic background, but she taught me something: if she has an off day and other people sway her from her centre, it’s because she didn’t spend time in the morning to give thanks and just ground herself through her prayers. You kind of water your garden in that way, right? Everyone has these rituals that water their garden, and if you see yourself as a flower or whatever, if you think metaphorically, you have to do those things, or it doesn’t feel right.  So wake up, a prayer and maybe shadowbox to some Young M.A. You’d have to wear some weighted gloves though.</p>

<h3 class="question">For what in life do you feel most grateful for?</h3>

<p>It varies day by day, some days I'll say my friends, when I’m really feeling... the bond, the oxytocin. Some days when I’m really <i>alone</i>, I’ll say I value my own company, and I’m really grateful for that. Today I’d say I’m really grateful for the connection I have with friends that are artistic. [laughs] I really... I guess I never valued it before... Friends with creative inclinations are valuable to me because I spend a lot of time with people that are very logic driven; I work with a bunch of engineers and hardware folk. Their idea of fun is like... I mean it <i>is</i> fun. [laughs] We were trying to plan a Christmas party and they’re factoring overage percentages on alcohol and chicken nuggets... and because of <i>that</i> I couldn’t order balloons. They’re like, “Your balloons are too expensive!”</p>

<h3 class="question">If you could wake up tomorrow and gain any ability/character trait, what would that be?</h3>

Confidence is such a super power; I think that confidence is the key to success. I don’t plan on being a real life female Tony Stark or anything, but if I wanted to, I’d need to have his confidence. So if I could, I would love to wake up tomorrow with a new story and basically have my story rewritten overnight so that it alters my self-image. Seeking too much external validation takes away from your art, it takes away from your work, it takes away from all this stuff you’re supposed to do in this lifetime, because you’re spending energy where you shouldn’t be spending. Everyone has their thing. I know <i>I</i> do—I require a lot of feedback because I grew up in an environment that was void of it, and any open display of support really... mostly just criticism.

<h3 class="question">If a crystal ball could tell you the truth about yourself, your life your future or anything else, is there something you would want to know?</h3>

<p>Yeah, like would I ever settle down and have kids or something? I never thought too much about it, but after seeing all these kids at this church my roommate took me to—all dressed in their Sunday bests... I want all of it. I literally want a school of them. I’m not sure what that was at all, but my roommates asked me, “So now you want one now, right?” I’m like, “Yeah!” I think in the future I would probably wanna know... yeah... would I ever find my “soulmate” or the person that I’m meant to share my life with?</p>

<h3 class="question">Is there something that you dreamed of doing for a long time, why haven’t you done it yet?</h3>

<p>Ohh uhmmm... I’ve actually wanted to do so many things. I wanted to be a DJ... I still think about it. People have said to me, “You have good taste in music, I could see you being a DJ,” I’m like, “I can see myself being a DJ.” That’s the coolest fantasy to have. Why I haven’t done this? I told myself that I needed money to be a DJ, so I can buy gear. I told myself that I’m too busy and I have no time. I mean I could do it digitally, I don’t need gear, I could just use some software. So basically I just told myself that I’m too busy and I don’t have time or something. But I really, really dig the fuck out of playing to an audience and controlling the floor and the vibe. I think I said earlier, “Whoever controls the music, controls the people.” [laughs] I think music can run an entire country, cause it gets you by the emotions, right?</p>

<h3 class="question">What is the greatest achievement in your life?</h3>

<p>Yo... like EVERYDAY is a fucking achievement, I’m just saying. I could finally admit to myself, let alone another person, that I’ve had a very challenging time coming into my own. There are days where I’m not feeling it. I think I go through phases where I just... disconnect or something? So my relation to the people and the world that is my life, it’s like... it’s kinda weird, I dunno what the word is, but... it’s all fragmented. I think it comes from feeling sadness… could be depression, So I know that I’m an anxious person and I can admit that. My greatest achievement is just making it, day-by-day. Cause these things that are hard, it’s hard to live life, being your own worst critic. At the same time, going hard for yourself, loving yourself enough to be your own best friend and fan.</p>

<p>If I wanted to quickly highlight some external achievements: my solo trips overseas, getting out of my comfort zone, taking those photos, doing all that. I took what little savings I had, put it to a first and last month’s rent on a downtown condo, bought some furniture from some chick that was moving out, turned it into an Airbnb and had one of the most interesting years of my life—at the age of 25. I’ve done a lot of cool shit basically, I’m not even saying it to brag. My stories and experiences are my credentials, and I am proud of that. [laughs]</p>

<h3 class="question">What do you value most in your relationships/friendships, could you describe what you look for in a best friend?</h3>

<p>I value... real, honest, emotional connection and intimacy. Few of my friends are dealing with their own stuff. I have friends like that, they’re actually some of the most beautiful people I’ve met because they’ve been through shit. What makes them beautiful is the fact that they’re willing to express themselves, to share their darkest thoughts. It’s very interesting to have that kind of perspective in your life, and I think that I haven’t expressed that really well but... I’m thinking in my head that anyone that shows their vulnerable side is a good litmus test for what makes a good friend.</p>

<p>After vulnerability is self-awareness, and being willing to admit that you fucked up. Because you can have a great, vulnerable relationship, but if you can’t admit that you were a half an hour late, that you fucked up, you’re just an asshole and we can’t be friends. I don’t care how deep the conversations are. [laughs]</p>

<h3 class="question">What is your most treasured memory?</h3>

<p>The snow days when we were younger, that’s when my circle of friends included one of my two brothers. I had two friends who both also had older brothers that all shared the same grade. So we kinda rounded out. There’d be three guys, three girls, and the “plus ones”, like the cousins of so-and-sos. We had our circle. When we had snow days, people would either come to my place or go to the homes of one of the other brother-sister duos, it was automatic, and we’d always have video games going. [smiles] So depending on what year it was... it’d be a different console, different games, Crazy Taxi, Star Fox or something like that. I remember snow days turning into like... a day for all of us to just game each other multiplayer style. It was cute, miss those days.</p>

<h3 class="question">If you knew that in one year you would die, is there anything you would change and why?</h3>

<p>There’s a good Ted Talk about this—Randy Pausch. He’s a professor and he wrote a book called “The Last Lecture”. He passed away from cancer. It was all about living a life to your fullest or something... as cliche as that sounds. But if I only had one year to live? I would love to throw the biggest birthday party of my life and actually have bare people come through from all over the globe, cause it’s my last one. I’d probably even have a fake wedding. I’d be like, “Who’s had the biggest crush on me? Yeah I kinda liked you too, let’s have a fake wedding and do some cool shit!” The artist in me would really come out and play. All this stuff is imaginary and make-believe anyway, so let’s go out with a bang.</p>

<h3 class="question">What roles do love and affection play in your life?</h3>

<p>It’s BIG. In a relationship, if the affection “doses” are high, if you’re checking that box, in terms of affection, I could look over a lot red flags. I thrive in those two elements. I think that’s when you’d probably see the best in me. I grew up to understand how big of a role communicating love and physically displaying affection can really change someone’s disposition on life, their attitude, and how they see themselves. It can make an unhealthy child healthy, an unconfident child, confident. It’s everything, it’s so much.</p>

<h3 class="question">How close and warm is your family?</h3>

<p>They’re not warm in the mainstream sense. To the outsider looking in, we’re a bit bizarre. There’s estrangement in our family so many of us don’t directly speak to the other. So the few that do, there’s this weird broken telephone thing happening where we feel like we know enough about everybody. My dad still calls me like three, four times a day to see if I’m safe and fed. I try to set those boundaries, cause I am getting older and there’s just no need, but he can’t change at his age: although he is still learning everyday from me and trying his best to respect my needs. These days we see eye-to-eye a lot more than when I was younger, mostly because I’ve been able to express myself without shame or guilt. It’s a strange dynamic sometimes, but it’s all love at the end of the day. I want them all to be happy. My mom and I are quite attached... that’s my heart.</p>

<h3 class="question">Help me complete this sentence, “I wish I had someone with whom I could share...”</h3>

<p>My life with.</p>

<h3 class="question">Before meeting you, what is something about you that people should know?</h3>

<p>That I am incredibly sensitive, I think so!</p>

<h3 class="question">What makes you laugh? what do you find humor in?</h3>

<p>[laughs] Stupid shit—memes and cat videos. Your friends that you party with, I love that stuff. Oh maybe watching old Fresh Prince and Seinfeld clips. You know what made my day? Someone was telling me their workplace frustrations, and they referenced that Arthur episode, “The Big Hit” where Arthur punches his sister D.W. So she breaks his toy plane right? and he’s like, “I TOLD YOU NOT TO TOUCH IT!” And there’s this frame where he tightens his fist before throwing it at D.W. That image is SUCH a mood sometimes.</p>

<h3 class="question">What do you like the most about yourself?</h3>

<p>I like my soft hands. [puts out hands]</p>

<h3 class="question">You like your soft hands? [feels it out] Oh geez you’re right.</h3>

<p>Yes. See I told you! [laughs]</p>


<h3 class="question">Can you share an embarrassing story?</h3>

<p>First thing that came to mind was when I was skipping rope in elementary school and my pants fell all the way down... was <i>clearly</i> not wearing underwear and my friends laughed at me cause they saw my ass. [laughs] But they were so goody-goody that they didn’t know how to tell me. I’m like,  “Bitch, I <i>knew</i> I mooned you!”</p>


<h3 class="question">When was the last time you cried in front of another person? When was the last time you cried to yourself?</h3>

<p>I’ve been more open about crying in front of people lately, because I remember the times where I was very closed off and outwardly calm and collected—it brought nothing good to my life. I was probably the biggest basket case at that time too. These days, the last time I cried in front of a person was probably when I teared up in front of my CEO. He really values me. For someone in his position to hold space for me like that is truly rare. I get overwhelmed with emotions easily now.</p>

<h3 class="question">What, if anything is too serious to joke about?</h3>

<p>I could laugh at jokes about other people’s appearances, but I don't want someone to be like... turn around and dish it out on me, cause that can be a trigger. Though I’ve sort of stopped caring about other people’s opinions about me now. I basically got the best career advice from a family friend who said, “People know not to joke around with me, they just don’t mess with me, cause I don’t laugh at any of their shit.” That’s the baseline, “Don’t joke around with me, and I won’t joke around with you. I don’t have a sense of humour. Bye.” Stay getting paid ladies.</p>

<h3 class="question">If you were to die this evening with not opportunity to communicate with anybody, what would you regret most not having told someone? Why haven’t you told them yet?</h3>

<p>Ohh wow... that I love people. That I love every single person that I have in my life, my family, my friends. It’d be probably be a lot of intimate sharing, stuff that... whatever my ego’s currently stopping me from doing, like apologizing. Being totally honest and vulnerable.</p>

<h3 class="question">Your house, containing everything you own, catches fire. After saving your loved ones and your pets, you have enough time to make one final dash to save any one item. What would that be, why?</h3>


<p>My MacBook—it’s my life, my wellbeing and my moneymaker. [smiles] It would be my backpack with <i>both</i> my laptops, can I do that? I assume I have my iPhone with me too, cause we always have our phones, right?</p>

<h3 class="question">Can you share a personal problem that you’re currently dealing with right now? What are the steps that you’re taking to resolve that issue?</h3>

<p>I think owning my identity is something that I’m starting to understand. It’s helping me take the reins on my life, because for a long time, I felt like I had to be everything to everybody. So drawing from some of the stories that we’ve talked about, my family, my job and whatever else... I play small, so that other people could feel comfortable. I think I learned from a young age, to not do or say or be anything that could make any other people around me uncomfortable, cause that’s what I thought self-preservation looked like. People controlled my destiny, everybody else has a say in my future but me, that kind of stuff. It’s a lot of fear-based thinking. The CEO was telling me was a shift into abundance, and when you’re a spiritual person, you love that kind of talk. It’s so easy to talk about fear-based, abundance-based, scarcity mindset and abundance mindset, but it’s like, what does that actually mean? How do you apply that stuff to the real world?  I’m going to distill it all into is trying to think from a more, “I already have enough, I am enough.” It’s going to alter my entire future, my story.</p>

<p>Also not give a shit.</p>

<h3 class="question">Any last words of general advice?</h3>

<p>I usually like... I don't know. A rule of thumb is to not... don’t give advice. Always be applying. When you’re at a job, don’t get comfortable: always be applying, always be interviewing. Always see what the market has in store for you. Basically see if there’s demand for your skills so that you can stay confident, and you just know that like, “Yo, this is nothing.” That’s how you shift from fear and scarcity to abundance—you have options. It’s like when you don’t have a lot going for you, you’ll take anybody, right? But that’s not what I really wanted to say, just filling in the silence. [laughs]</p>

<p>One thing I will say though, and I pinned this to my Twitter profile: “People don’t suffer from depression, depression is a symptom. Many depressed people suffer from forsaking their dreams and passions for ideals and beliefs society has afflicted them with. People are not answering their calling, not following their hearts.” Long story short, there’s a Hamlet quote, “To thine own self be true.” I’ve heard it so many times that I consider it synchronistic. CEO’s the other day said to me, “To thine own self be true.” I’m like, “Why is everyone saying this quote when it’s my favorite one of all time?” At the same time these are the people that are going to champion <i>Jess</i>.</p>
