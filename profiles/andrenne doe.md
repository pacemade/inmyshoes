So as you know, my name is andrenne, artist name andrenne or im also known as drena, drena the runway diva, or… yeah! Just andrenne.
I’m a visual artist and arts educator and entertainer, storyteller, model. I grew up in Jamaica. I grew up in Montego Bay Jamaica. I came here with my family, like in… all my family came before me, but i came over with my brother. I cam bakc in 2001 and i lived in scarborough. I grew up in scarborough, yeah, yeah yeah, so. In terms of my artistry and what inpired me to be an artist. When I was 5 years old, my cousin, I found my cousin painting and he’s a deaf painter in jamaica. I couldn't communicate with him or anything like that, but i was like “why” you know? And I went to school close by him. So whenever there were like lunch breaks or stuff like that, I would run over to see what he was doing, how far he progressed with his painting and I just remember sittingby his easel and being amazed, I wanted to learn how to paint portraits like this

So anyways, so then years later, to fast forward, immigrated to canada right? scarborough. Then I had my first official art class with actual art teachers, just focused. Before it was kinda like, I just would make things out of whatever I found, you know? Like on the floor, like garbage or like you know? just came up with like sculptures, or just things like that. But i wanted to paint, I wanted to be a painter, i had that dream. So i moved here and had my first art class, right? in grade 7

you already knew where you wanted to go

ohh, i knew what i loved. They had markers, they had crayons, they had the whole shebang. I dont think they had paint or anything like that. So I still wasnt doing the painting, but I was being creative, I was using colors. That was my main love, right?

And then you know… went to high school. I was not tied down by doing art class and things like that,because  I felt I was too cool, my friends werent into that. So I still remained creative. I did take art courses in high school and things like that but, i mean like whatever. It was after school, really, after HS where art really started to come in for me. I was telling the story of this artist friend of mine who I grew up with. She gave me an art book and it was like my FIRST book. A drawing fundamentals book and it was one of the first gifts, you know, that I ever received that I felt like somebody really thought about what I was into. And I felt obligated to read this book obviously, I was big on all of that, but I was really excited because it was a book about art and how I could improve myself as an artist. And I would read it back to back to back to back. They had exercises in it, I would copy every single thing in that book. Until I got better I noticed like my drawing skills was on another level. like I was on the subway, like sketching and doodling all the time. you know how the bus shakes and train moves and all of that

you kinda have to move with it

ohh i was on it, i was on it. I even thought about becoming a tatoo artist at one point because my motors skills was just SO on point. That I was like “yo I could do this” I didnt. It was like “oh well you gotta have tatoos to be a tattoo artist, is what people kept saying right? So i was like “okay whatever” But i tried a bunch of things, right?

I taught art for quite some time, like for a long time I taught kids. Through this organization, like an arts organization. I worked with children and youth and peers and everybody, right? And as I would teahc a kid how to develop themselves, I would go home and still have my studio, I still had my studio where I was still working and keeping that going, cause what usually happens with art teachers, like they end up stopping, doing their own practises for whatever reason, I dont know. Maybe it gets too much right? But for me, I couldn’t stay away from art, like anyways.

Its like an itch almost

Its like I HAVE to create, like I can’t see myself NOT creating, I’ve always been a createive. I’ve always been the type of person where shes like “Oh i cant afford it? Okay cool, well I’m going to use, make something out of this” and then it turns to something that people are like “oh woooooow, what is that?” or something that people just have never seen before, or something that people want more of, right? That gave me confidence, right? And yeah, so when I had tools that were actual tools that you know came from an art store, an actual paint palette, its like “okay” it was time for me to master that as well and take it to the next level.

From teaching children, i remember you told me at one point you were an art curator, you helped people put on art shows, how did that come to be?

I have a lot of experience uhmmmmm……putting shows together, I volunteered with uhhh like galleries to put their shows on, and I was young, sooo (laughs) I was young, so it didnt really…. I dont know they gave me opportunities to put my work too. They’d be like “ohh you can put your work in the show, like youre helping you can sell it” And that was my introduction to professional art gallery shows. Yeeah, did that for a few years.

what compelled you to finally start working on your art show back in sept. what was the spark or moment where you wer like “i need ot do this"

For the last couple years, I was thinking about doing my show, because I realized I didn’t have like, my own show. I think I shy'd away everytime I had the opportunity to do something for me. I would always do it on a larger scale and involve as many people, just because I know a lot of people that do you know? that art in the industry that are artists and I feel like “why not just share that?” You do this then you do that, I do this, lets do something together. And that was very much a leader in making sure that there were I guess, platforms for myself and other youths. So I did that, but then I realized “omgosh” I still have not done something for ME. you know what i mean? celebrating my work. So I said “okay” im going to do this show because…. i need it….for me, right? Not jsut for me, but its still for everyone right? But i neeeeeed, i neeeed a room filled with art that was made by myself or, you know? came from my own, like, how can I transform this paint and you know make it my own. and can i handle that?

So being in the arts sphere, doing what you do, whatre some problems that you deal with that other people might not have to deal with? What are ome issues or hustles that you had to put yourself through?

myself?

yeah, that you probably dont think other people have to deal with

well you have me being female, right? uhh, there are challenges that come with that and there are also challenges that comes with me being, one a female, me being a black female, me being uhhh… lets see. Growing up in what one would call an understurbed, underpriviledged community, is what they would call it. SO basically, what one would call the ghetto. Like, there’s so many barriers that you face as an individual with all of that, right? So many loopholes, so many… but for me it always motivated me to you know? go harder because I feel like we deserve the things that make me me and i  embrace that and i also. embracing that gives me confidence and it also sets me apart you know what I mena? Cause what is gconsidered ghetto is considered magic, its considered beautiful, its considered one of a kind, right? So, you have some people that will see it on the flip side like its a downer right? and you have some people thats just like “naw” its something that makes me shine, everything like that makes it so great and magical, and something to celebrate, not something to, you know, hold me back, or stay away from.

I never heard anyone describe it that way, I can see how it has shaped you into who you are

and then you still run across people whos always gonna… you know hold you down. But its too late for me, like i’ve already fallen in love with me, ive already fallen in love with the journey.

So now that you are where you are, what are some tips or things that you did that you wold pass on and share?

I feel like i’ve always been the same person, thats one thing. In HS i definitely was on the side of the fence that was like …. i had to work my way into being “cool” i had to work my way into being respected, i had to work for that. And that comes with, not so much work with other people, but more so like, work on yourself. So when somebody believes you or somebody teases you or somebody puts you down, you really go home and you really let those messages eat you away and tear you down, or you do the work on yourself and realize that “naw thats not true”, and theres something special about me and im going to share that with the world. Thats what you’re gonna see, that confidence. And people have no choice but to love it and accept it and thats ALL they see, I mean, people see what you want them to see, right?

So something I was share with people is to basically turn water into wine (laughs) you know what i mean? With that pain, with that thing, that very thing that is either put down, or forbidden, or not celebrated by other people is the very thing that makes you unique, right? So I would say to spend time with that thing and to examine that thing. And if you spend enough time with it, you realize that it’s something to love and to show, as opposed to something to be insecure about, or let stop you, right?

thank you for that, so on to the other questions

first question is: would you like to famous and in what way?

(laughs) i dont know what do you mean? what do you mean by fame though?

well what would you consider as fame?

would i want to be famous? I dunno what that means! like

uuhhhmmm would you want to be at a point where when you’re walking downt he street, people would recognize who you are?

uhmmmmm it depends, for what, right? What do they want to recognize me for? something detrimental or great? Ofc respect is always great, I would love to meet as many people as I can and I would love for my art as well as my story, as well as the WHOLE VIBE OF ME, to reach as many people because I feel like it is something that people SHOULd experience. especially people who need it, right? So that’s what matters to me, but if that’s fame then thats fame,

Cause i remember you mentioned to em once that it was a dream of yours to see people down the street wearing your shit

I want people to be wearing my stuff, I want people to have my art in their spaces, but not just to just put it out, no. Because its like, they really connect with it, they really connect with me, they really connect with my story, you know what I mean?

So given a choice of anyone in the world, D/A who would you have dinner with?

Who would I invite to a dinner party?

dead or alive, yeah

Dead or alive…. who would i? hoooold on… my SHADOW! can I say that?

of course!

I say that because we spend so much time running from ourselves right? Just hating ourselves, when you look at shit at the end of the day. If we all look for someone to blame for our shit, we go around sometimes looking for that person to blame for all the wrongs, or tht person to thank for all the rights. But either way, at the end of the day, it all comes down to YOU. So im saying, all of that stuff that I tried to run away from, or shy away from. Myself. I would sit down with myself, my shadow and have a heart-to-heart.

WOW, thats amazing, first one you’re smashing it omgoodness

its true!when you think about it because nobody is more importnat than YOU

I love that you are so in tune with yourself like that. What would constitute a perfect day for you, from the moment you wake up, to when you go to bed?

the perfect day? that’s so great. For me, its to yeah, be in tune that whole day, actually. Throughout the day, because its hard to stay, like , so centered, right? but to always be in a place where I can see everyone as a reflection of me, right? Where were not disconnected, where its like it looks very, you know like “ohh that looks negative” or “that looks bad”. when you see yourself, you’re more compassionate, you’re more understanding to whatever you’re seeing, right?. So a day for me, regardless of where im at, regardless of what It looks like, of perfection, is just being, remaining, centered, remaining, in tune. I have the best days, and I used to think it was “ohh i want a vacation that’d be great” or “ohh i wish I had all this money its great” I got to work on time, whatever it was, we realize “oh shoot” like I remember the time I was late for work and it was still a really good day. Was it that? and it was like “nah” i think it was something about being aligned and you know..making something out of nothing

so its not really something that you do that gives you a perfect day, moreso your mindset.

yeah

when was the last time that you sang to yourself and what song was it?

ha! that i sang to myself? uhmmm…………….wow…..

if not-

probably last night, but i cant recal what song it was. showering, shower singer, yeah

for what in life are you most grateful for?

Im grateful for …. Im greatful for people. People that I can connect with and learn from and build with, like i appreciate that. Just connections.

Some people are complete opposite, they dont want anyhting to do with people right?

Yeah for me, I try to learn soemthing from everyone, like where would i be with people? Like i mean i sure itll be okay too, but even if not people, I also consider all tings, like all living things, like living, and teaching right?

if you change anything in how you were raised or how you grew up, how would you change it?

if i could change anything……hmmmmmmmmmm….how i was raised……hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm…………OH hmm, I would chaaaaaange…….I mean like, (laughs) okay, I can go the cliche way, and be like “I wouldnt change a thing cause i wouldnt be who i am today” But if i really had to say something it would be that, people around me tend to be more fearful and guarded. So when you are raised by people who are fearful and guarded (not everybody), but the people who where directly like “ohh you cant come here because of dd—d-ddah”, its just like I wanted to go out, I wanted to see, the world. And I was really held back from doing that. so thats one thing, you know?

so you think you would gotten to where you are now quicker?

i dunno about that, I feel like we are where we are, and thats just what it is, right? But if I had to say something it’s just, yeah I’ve always been an explorere and I’ve always liked that and i think (laughs), i mean I get the whole “NO, dont go over there,NO dfd-f-dfd-dah”. Like I dont even know jamaica as much as I would like to, i didnt really get to travel, go places. Even my family they make fun of me because of that like “you dont know anyhwre in jamaica, you dont know anything!” theyre kinda right, yeah. It was very different when I came here though.

Do you have plans of going back?

Yeah i’ve visteted and I plan to, but there are other places that I’d like to see as well.

coooooooooooool, if theres somthing that youve dreamed of doing in a long time?

Coming to Canada, for a VERY long time

since you were a kid?

YEEEAAAH man, that was the dream, that was the focus, yeaahh. I held on to that, my mom was here right? So she would tell me of the life here and I would be liek “WOOOOOOOW” (laughs). Mad malls, shopping, this, that, like I totally was like “okay”, so its like I saw the world before I even got here, so when I got here, it was kinda like ‘wow” like actually seeing it, you know?

ooookay, did no expect that. Whats the greatest accomplishment so far in your life?

Greatest accomplishment? (laughs) for me, i know this is gonna sound… off, yeah. But i think I’ve really, really, mastered (laughs)… forgivness. That is my biggest accomplishment and that is smething that I did for me, at a very early age. And I say that because that is the most important thing I think, is to be… able to you know.. forgive and also to accept, you know? just (laughs) yeah!

Woo, thats a good insight, got curveballs on me, because I was expecting the answer to be the art show that you held

nooo nonono, these things, these tings are very ahh.. i think i wouldnt say it’s easy to do, its not easy to do, right? But when you wanna talk about REAL HARD SHIT to do, it’s really forgiving people. And I realize people have a hard time doing that. And the more I see that “wow people have a hard time letting go of things like that”, depending on what it is, but you do it for yourself, not for everybody, right? Even when you tell that that you forgive them, you dont necessarily do it for them, its for YOU, in order for you to evolve and to jsut… you know.. to transcend.

Soo waht do you value most in your friendships and can you describe a best friend?

Ohh what do I value the most? In a friendship? mmmmmm (thinks).. most….mmmmmmmmmmm. Im gonna say loyalty. Loyalty is real, is real big. Loyalty is a big big thing. And describe a best friend? (laughs) no, i dont, i dont really, i dont have best friends (laughs). I dont believe in those things, but i think loyalty is important and uhh…. Okay i shouldnt say I dont have a best friend, i dunno what Im saying, a particular person, individual, I dont give too many people THAT title, because (laughs), that’s setting yourslef up, to…you know?

what is your most treasured memory?

Most treasured memory? yo, i think my most treasured memory, are memories of me just walking around in jamaica, just barefooted, climbing trees… you know? doing shit that people should be doing, just chillin, eating mangoes, building forts, like one of the, I had just a very interesting childhood. Me and my cousins we would take off and go in the bush. We call it gulley, right? some people call it “jungle, forest GULLEY” we’d go into the gully and we would spend the WHOLE, DAY. I mean, like, the time was okay, right? SO parents werent,like “omgsh, where did they go” nah, liek e would travel, FAR, PLACES, and we would build tents, we would go fishing. I mean we were kids, OUR ideas of “dollhouse” was like a whole day thing. We would fish, and cook, actually cook. Like build fires. Those were some great memories, yeah it was amazing. And im just like, its such a different life now, right? Even back home now, people aren’t living like that anymore. That so, like omgsh i got to experience that, that was our childhood.

so to flip it on its head, whats your most terrible memory?

terrible? (laughs, a lot) uhmm….. terrible….. mmmmmmmm

like a bad experience or

theres plenty, but like, okay, the most, I wont go there. The hardest one required learning, like forgivness and all of those things, right? But uhmmm….. i think one of the hardest things was like being teased for being a girl, or being black or, for having hair texture like I do. I think that was one of the hardest things because uhmm, partially hated on myself for a second because I felt like, wow like, theyre right! But it wasnt for a long time, it didnt mold me into, you have adults tha still go around with stories on self hate and its like “damnnnn, youre still on that?” so its a real thing, so im glad that did that work.

how close are you to your family

ohh! were all close, yeah my family. I used to think we werent, but… yeah! but then people would be like “wow! you and your family, you guys are so close”. we laugh, we cry, we go through. What i appreciate most about my family, whatever we go through, we go through together. So if its a moment of happines, a moment of depression, a moment of struggle, we’re in it together and we understand that were going to go it HROUGH togehter. and i LOOOVE when families like are like that.

so off of that, what roles do love and affection play in your life?

mmmmmm…. love and affection in my life. Okay, so, love? and affection. Im very affectionate, im very expressive, its like if i was taught to speak, I try my best when it comes to love, i love HARD. When it comes to hate, Im human (laughs), im human, right? SO im not perfect. This idea of love, like whatever it is, its a feeling, definitely. And I enjoy that, I enjoy that with myself, a lot….a lot. Because you can show that same affeciton and love to pepole and they dont get it, like they dont get it or they’re offended by it or they just dont accept it, they dont want it. So i’ve spent a lot of time practising love and affection with self. and i really ship that and project that with people, just the way that I want to be treated, the way that I want to be told, the way that I want to be…valued. I just try my best to…BE that right? yeah, that’s what I have to say about that

Ok, help me complete this sentence “i wish i could have someone whom which i could share _______"

hmm…shaaaaaare, vibes with! (laughs), like build it, create with. But then again, I do, im not alone in this world, theres always people. Im saying ending that sentence, I wish I could have someone to vibe with

what do you like most about yourself?

what do i like most about myself? thats kinda hard, i love everything about myself! but MOST, is….my self expression, just the way that i express myself is not a particular way, its through everything that I do, and I’m very unapologetic at that, and I love that.

I can definitely see that

YEAH! (laughs)

yeah, not everybody can do something and be okay with it.

Yeah its all about intention, when you’re seated in you know. Having my intentions are good, my intentions are pure. Even if it comes across as like, yeah, its just like no. Sometimes what you accept, how people see things, its just not, you can’t help that, right? and if you spend a lot of time trying to focus on, you know? helping people see YOU, the way you want to be seen, like, things you just get lost in the sauce. Just focus on doing you and know? just do it with the intent, good, bad, whatever, do you, and own it and accept it, you know what i mean? it is what it is, be balanced

can you share an embarassing story?

……..yes (laughs) this is one that I liek to share. I’ve shared this beofre. So one time, i was making out with this guy. and we were making out in the dark…. we turn the light on.. his shirt. was covered. in brown. makeup…..hi white shirt. Because i was wearing foundation and all this shit. And he was like “OHHH” his reaction was like “what the fuck?” like how do you explain that? i was like “ohhhh” so embarassed. I really had to think about, shit, how much makeup i was wearing. but its whatever, it was EMBARASSING for me, cause guys, they dont think about how we wear makeup, put on a fresh white shirt and then its not.

What if anyhting, is too serious to joke about?

What is too serious to joke about? uhhhhhmm…. disabilities.

ooooooo

I dont like that, i dont like that, its just sometimes people cant really help who they are, and when people make fun of that shit, its just, its like it felt so, its not far off from making fun of people who look the way that they do. Like you came out of the womb like taht, who are you to say that youre better than this person, who are you to say this person is ugly, or this person is uhhm, ohh like “retarded” like those words. I mean like, dunno, just, i dont like putdowns, basically…so...

yeah, i can definitely agree with that, its not something that someone can control.

What is currently creating buzz in your professional fields, whats on the up and up?

the up and up?….. MEEEEEEEE, mEEEEEE, anything that i dooooo! (laughs) I mean people are jsut excited about, like, i realized people are just excited about ANYTHING that i do, not just my paintings. And I think thats because… no not even I think, I know its because anything I do, im always putting my 100%. So people are like “oh you do this too???!” and its like yeah, its all, art, to me. So, everything is all on the up and up, and i think people are just excited about what’s next and whatre you doing and, cuse they know whatever I do is gonna be JUst as powerful.

that about wraps it up! so when people reading your profile, i kinda want to give a playlist for them to get into your head, any songs they could listen to to get a good idea of what goes on in andrennes head?

well nobody can get into my head, really, and i would NOT, RECOMMEND ANYBODY to even try to like, wrap their head around this, like. cause you might go nuts! To get on my frequency, i mean, the best way to do that is to….. pull out those crayons, pull out those markers, pull out those paints, throw some jazz on and have a vibe! like you knw? get a canvas, get a piece of paper, and thats the way to MEET me! If you’re on that creative frequency of like, just loving to create and not being fearful of that. because im not a fear-based person, right? theres a lot of fear when it comes to creating something, everbodys like “ohhh mg it has t be perfect!” and its like yo, anybody can meet me there, you know what i mean? we can all meet on a vibe, a frequency of creating and loving and enjoying it, enjoying the process, and that’s what it’s about. EVEN if you dont like what comes out of it, like “ohh this wasnt that great” thats fine! thats okay, just enjoy the process!

Sometimes i like the neo-soul vibe, i like to listent o erykah badu, jill scott you know, chronixxx? I switch it up, it depends on the days, I legit im like “hmm, todaaay, i feel like listening to some trap” i listen to everything, i appreiate artists that are telling their stories, i dont care that i cant really relate with that, you know? Its more im listening to that person’s story, and if its like, its more like, i can really relate from people who come through you know, like the uh, how do you say, the ghetto, the hood, i can really relate to them, because having uhh, you know, raised through that whole culture, its kinda like “damn” the depseration for like, the need to create, to survie, the need to take care of your family, the need ot take care of your community, the need to keep back, its like “damn” like, i relate to that so much, so evn if its in a hip hop song, a reggae song, im just like “yeaah me too, i get it"
