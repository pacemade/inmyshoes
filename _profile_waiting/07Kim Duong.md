<h1 class="to-fade-up">Okay...</h1>

I grew up in Scarborough and went to an elementary school that was not very well funded... we lived in a pretty bad neighbourhood. Well it wasn't the worst, it was just next to a really bad neighbourhood. I remember one time my brother got a new bike, and this is really funny: somebody, like this kid, came by and stole the bike, and he left his shitty bike. (laughs) That was the type of neighbourhood we grew up in. The school I went to, they had the breakfast program there... which I loved so dearly, because my parents worked a lot and they didn’t know anything about nutrition so they just packed the fridge full of Michelina’s tv dinner—my comfort food. I LOVE pasta, I LOVE TV dinner SO much, I don’t know how that might have affected my brain development... (laughs) With all that sodium and all, but whatever, I turned out okay. (smiles)

My mom was a handicapped school bus driver and a lunch monitor. She just like… wanted us to succeed so badly that she decided to move us to Markham. So we decided to live with my aunt for a bit, we could get her Markham address and go to a really fancy French-Emersion school. We managed to get there and I had a really, <i>really</i> hard time fitting in: I came from Scarborough with my bootleg Hello Kitty clothes, (laughs) and these kids had American Eagle and Abercrombie. So I had no friends, pretty much... I struggled for acceptance socially... I thought I was weird and I couldn’t fully express my individuality. When I came home and cried about it, my parents didn’t understand me, and because my mom was always so busy and upset and everything, every time I tried to express myself they’d be like “No I don’t want to hear it right now.” I felt like most of my childhood... I didn’t have the opportunity to express myself, so I seeked for validation in my teachers and I did <i>really</i> well in school. Like EXTREMELY well in school.

So I grinded in elementary school and got top grades, same in high school. Just trying really hard to be an over-achiever, but it’s just the feeling of needing that validation followed me throughout most of my childhood, up until early adulthood. When applying for university (I eventually got into Laurier), I remember having NO idea what to do. I applied to art, like… OCAD, I wanted to be a French teacher, I wanted to be an orthodontist, and I had no idea... maybe business? I had no guidance cause my parents didn’t go to university. I was so jealous of all these Asian kids who had their parents tell them what to do. I remember feeling so depressed because I was just like, “Why can’t my parents be normal, like these parents? Why can’t I have guidance?” We never really had guidance as kids, just wild, and winging everything. Mind you I’m still winging it, we’re all just winging it. Because of that, and everything I’ve gone through, I’ve learned to be completely comfortable in myself, and to have thicker skin because I was bullied. I realize now that because I don’t fit in most of these places, it’s because I’m here to make a difference, make a change.

Went to university and I really tried first year. I only chose Laurier because some of my friends chose it, I had NO idea what to do. At lunch, I would go to the lunch room and I wouldn’t know who to hang out with, and it was just like… the WORST was lunch. Everyone looked forward to lunch cause they could play with their friends but I’m just like “Who am I gonna hang out with?” I just felt <i>so</i> alone, and lonely... sad... I needed validation and I had nobody.

<div class="quote to-fade-up">
  <h2>"{{ page.quote1 }}"</h2>
</div>

So after first year, my grades were slipping. It was hard because there was no structure and I didn't really have a support system. I applied for co-op, and co-op is a <i>really</i> big deal, you have to get into co-op or your life is over: that was the perspective that I had. I went into the interview with like, the tightest dress pants—I was so unprofessional back then. Coming out of the interview, I thought I <i>killed</i> it... but I didn’t get it. I remember that day <i>so</i> clearly: it was raining outside, I went to visit my boyfriend at the time in Hamilton and I was just like, so depressed and, “Fuck this... My life is over...” That’s when the partying began.

I started drinking, started going out, I started getting all of this validation and attention. People started being attracted to me. I never ever really got any attraction from guys... <i>ever</i>, until second year. So I pretty much went all out... to the point where I thought that was my life now. My grades went from a B+ average to C-. (laughs) So I remember, after that I was already set on being a club promoter, I invited my dad over; he went to visit me and I told him that I was going to drop out of university to be a club promoter. I told him, “I’m gonna drop out, I can’t do this anymore, I’m really social and I could do this partying thing.” He was so disappointed in me, it broke his heart.

I worked at a restaurant.... spent all my money on weed. Then I met this guy named Chris and we started going out. I idealized him and put him on a pedestal. He was studying for his CPA and he was in accounting. So I was just like, “He’s so smart, I wish I could be like that.” He believed in me more than I believed in myself. I decided to stay and just focus on school and apply to jobs on my own. He helped me revise my resumes and stuff. I didn’t know at the time that it was a toxic love... he was perfect in <i>that</i> way, but in other ways he kind of put me down, was jealous of my past, made me feel very unlovable. I was always crying, I was really depressed, but it was also very young love; we had no idea what we were doing. So at one point, it was too much drama; I couldn’t deal with it any more and I broke up with him.

The time I broke up with him, I found out that my mom and dad had just divorced. Within a month after, we found out that my dad went to Vietnam and got married... to a random that we’ve never heard of. Obviously my mom was <i>so</i> upset, she was SO upset. We decided to book a trip for her to go to Florida. We went to Florida, and at that time this was less than I week since I broke up with my ex. I was in Florida and my aunt, for some reason decided that I wasn’t allowed to use the internet or my phone. My ex messaged me saying that his dad was hospitalized and that he’s gonna die. I totally missed that, and he’s like, “Come home, you should’ve come home, you should’ve flown in.” I had to choose between his dad dying and my mom. It was a tough situation, but I decided to stay with my mom, and I flew back in time for the funeral. At the time, his mom grabbed my hand and cried to me, and she was just like, “Kim, we need you in his life, he needs to finish his exams and he needs you.” So I decided to stay with him another year, and during that time I was the... <i>best</i> girlfriend ever. I’d pull out the accounting text books and I helped him study. While helping him study I noticed to myself like, “I could do this, like I could actually do this!”

<div class="profile_double">

So I decided to hit up the registrar, they were just like, “This is perfect timing, all you have to do is take another semester.” So I went to school for three semesters in a row, studied my ass off, got back straight A’s, got into an accounting firm. When I got that I was like, “Holy shit… I can achieve anything... anything I put my mind to.” That was really cool.

<div class="quote to-fade-up">
  <h2>"{{ page.quote2 }}"</h2>
</div>

I came back to the firm, I thought it was going to be more glamorous than it was, but it was so tough. I didn’t like the work I was doing, I didn’t like the hours, I mean, I tried <i>really</i> hard, like SO hard, I beat myself up so much I’m always so hard on myself. My priority at the time was to write the accounting exams. First accounting exam I wrote... I failed. (laughs) I thought it was the worst, but I decided to rewrite it... and I passed, and then the second exam after that, I failed. (laughs) I wrote it again and I passed that too eventually. Then the last exam I wrote, this was when I started changing my life. I started becoming more positive, I started had taking care of myself: more balance, less stress. I passed with flying colors, even finished early! At that time it was funny because I had become vegan. During the day with exam results, most people would drink away their worries; I decided to go to a slaughter house. I realized that there were bigger issues in the world right now, than a made-up piece of paper that people sought out for social validation. I decided to do that and everyone thought I was crazy because I was going to be the lead auditor for the biggest meat and cheese distributor in Canada. (laughs) WHAT A CONFLICT!

One of my managers, who I’m super for grateful now, I think she still hates me but... I wasn’t doing a good job and she called me out on it. She told all the managers to fire me pretty much. I needed to find something for myself... to <i>do</i> on the weekend, to actually... just have something, I need to do something that brings me joy. This sounds really cocky but, I LOVE taking selfies, but how do I make this so that it’s a thing, where I could post shameless selfies without being judged? ...I could do a makeup page! (laughs) I was terrible at it, I was so bad at makeup in the beginning. I would spend like an hour doing makeup, and then I would cry because it was <i>so</i> ugly. I kept doing it and then I got way better. I got REALLY good at that while still working at the firm, I had already checked out.

I was sitting with a client, with my manager, and I got a notification on my phone: “Anastasia Beverly Hills…. something something,” and I'm like “That's Kim Kardashian’s eyebrow lady like whats up with that?” Then all of the sudden my Instagram started blowing up, and I’m freaking out. It turns out she reposted one of my pictures on her 12 million followers page. Was this not a blunt sign form the universe or WHAT? I turn over to my manager and I’m like, “Patrick I’m sorry but this is my calling.” That was a huge calling for me, and I decided to quit and I did makeup. I got shouted out by multiple pages, big makeup pages, and I didn’t even have to try, not that I’m bragging right now. I’m just saying that unshakable belief in yourself to succeed and get what you want, that was 100% percent of my life dedicated to that. After that, I decided to do wedding makeup... but at the same time I was also struggling with money. My Ex at the time was like, “You need to get a job, you’re not doing anything at home, like you’re lazy.” That’s when I found my next job. (laughs)

I was really beat up by the fact that I wasn’t getting any jobs off the bat, you know, looking for jobs suck. I remember coming after a job interview that COMPLETELY sucked and I decided to change my destiny. I decided to tell the universe that I’m willing to surrender to a better opportunity and I’m willing to accept. the very next day, one of my recruiting firms contacted me and was like, “You wanna work for a tech firm? Here’s the salary.” That was more money than I’d ever seen in my life. Went in for the interview... when it’s meant to be it happens so fast, I got in right away. That allowed me to save, so that I could do makeup full time... I dunno... I’m just so grateful! Every single thing, every single hardship and bad thing that happened in my life before that I cried over, has led me to doing what I absolutely love now.

<h3 class="question">Working at a salon, what are some problems and issues that others might not experience?</h3>

First off, it’s a pretty risky business—what I do. I deal with a lot of anxiety when it comes to tattooing people’s faces, cause you only have one shot to do it, right? I really had to learn on my own how to keep things safe for people, and also do a really good job at managing my clients: being able to distinguish who to take and who to not take, even when I need the money. I care a lot about excellence in my work; I’m a perfectionist, I love to be proud of my work. If I’m not proud of it and it’s on somebody’s face... it’s actually a lot of pressure.

<div class="profile_extra1">

<h3 class="question">Given the choice of anyone in the world, dead or alive, who would you invite to a dinner party? Why?</h3>

Definitely not my 19 year old self, with that potty mouth (laughs). I’d invite my future self, cause I’m really super looking forward to who I’m becoming. I wrote a letter to my future self, I was pretty depressed about three months ago and I couldn’t pull myself out of it. It was spiralling out of control: I was sabotaging my business because of my attitude on money, and not making enough and not being good enough. So one of my good friends messaged me telling me to write a letter to my future self one year from now, and I did. It was pretty cool and I felt really good about it. (laughs) I wrote like, “Dear Kim, remember when you thought you couldn’t support mom and you couldn’t support yourself? What a joke! Look at you! you have your own place now, a dream salon, you don’t have to worry about anything!” It was kind of a manifestation activity as well, but yeah... I’m really super excited to see who I’m becoming. I’m so excited to meet my future self, even if it’s blank because there’s nothing. (laughs) It's just the blackness like, “Oh shit did I die? Okay cool!"

<h3 class="question">Would you like to be famous one day? If so in what way, if not why?</h3>

I would definitely love to be recognized for my work if I were to be famous, I wouldn't want it to be for... like looks or for consumerism—making people buy things and make them insecure. I wanna be influential more than famous, and I want to be influential in a way that helps the environment, that helps the animals. I want to be able to be that person that people look up to and ask, “How do I be like you?” Everything that I believe in, I want to be able to share that. It’s not because I want to feel great about myself, it’s because I feel like it’s absolutely necessary for people to have these values right now. Not to buy things online or be a celebrity, or get plastic surgery, or have all these things fed to them so they could find validation. Have a beautiful soul! I’m saying that even though I’m in the beauty industry. (laughs) I empower people, if they want an upgrade they can talk to me, but I will never tell someone they need their brows done. I see their soul, and I don’t even look at their face. I do what I feel based on how I feel about their soul, and it just turns out well every single time. I’ve never had a makeup look that I didn’t like.

<h3 class="question">What would constitute a perfect day for you?</h3>

I guess full presence? (laughs) Yeah, fully being immersed in the experience and surrendering to the moment. It’s tough sometimes cause it’s hard not to think, but the best things happen when you go with the flow… like the right flow—ones with <i>good</i> vibes. I’ve gone with the flow before with not good vibes, coulda died. (laughs)


<h3 class="question">Would you want to change the way you were raised?</h3>

I would be vegan since birth. (laughs) I would! I wonder how my health would be if I was pure whole foods and vegan since birth.


<h3 class="question">When was the last time you sang to yourself? To someone else?</h3>

I sang to myself today at work. (laughs) I always sing to myself. It wasn’t necessarily singing, but I discovered the melodeon. It’s like a mouthpiece keyboard and it sounds like a string instrument. So I played that, and I needed to share this instrument right? So I played Hallelujah and I posted it online. It turns out it was close to the date of Leonard Cohen’s death, so I had people messaging me like, “Oh a beautiful rendition!”(laughs) Oh man the timing!

<h3 class="question">For what in life are you most grateful for?</h3>

I am just so grateful to be able to have perspective based on the experiences that I had in the past, and I’m so grateful for hardship, cause it teaches me to be empathetic. Yeah, there you go, simple. (smiles)

<h3 class="question">If you could wake up tomorrow and gain any ability/character trait, what would it be?</h3>

Unlimited access to my third eye, cause I mean, I’ve done DMT before, and you feel this pressure. You actually literally feel pressure here [points where third eye would be], and it just expanded into... just the <i>infinite</i>. It gives you such a profound understanding that there is so much more than just this. When you come back to this, you kinda just let go of things more easily.

<h3 class="question">If a crystal ball could tell you the truth about yourself, your life, the future or anything else, what would you want to know?</h3>

<div class="quote to-fade-up">
  <h2>"{{ page.quote3 }}"</h2>
</div>

No I wouldn’t, cause then you’d be focusing on that instead of being present. I know truly within that I’m aligning, to the best of my ability, my actions with my values, so as long as I know that, it doesn’t matter.


<h3 class="question">Is there something that you’ve dreamed of doing for a long time, if so why haven’ you done it yet?</h3>

Clean my car... [laughs hysterically] and organize my tax stuff.


<h3 class="question">What is the greatest achievement of your life?</h3>

Aligning my actions with my values and living that day, to the best of my ability. That is full authenticity, I remember living without that, you know when you just feel like a phoney? You just have this underlying guilt that you’re not doing what you thought was right, you don’t feel good. It’s an necessary wave, and you don’t feel free; subconsciously you don’t even feel free.


<h3 class="question">What do you value most in your friendships?</h3>

Someone who I can completely be myself around without judgement. I don’t really look for friends anymore, they just kinda come into my life based on my vibes. I just know intuitively if we click or not.


<h3 class="question">What is your most treasured memory?</h3>

<div class="quote to-fade-up">
  <h2>"{{ page.quote4 }}"</h2>
</div>

December 17th, 2014. I remember... I was at such a low point and none of my friends wanted to deal with me anymore. I felt like such a burden to the world. That day, I decided that if I were to die—it wouldn’t matter. I woke up already having that intention, to just like obliterate my life. (laughs) I can laugh about this now. I wasn’t even scared, it was just numb. I hadn’t reached that point, I had so much shame and guilt from everything that happened to me in my childhood, early adulthood... all the bad stuff that was carried and that was not released, <i>and</i> I was in a job that I hated. December 17th, 2014 I decided I wanted to die. That day, right when I caught myself, I’m like, “Fuck I need to reach out to somebody.” So I reached out to my soul sister and she was like, “Oh! Uhh… I-I’ll connect you to this life coach I just met... on Tinder.” (laughs) I know! He met me right away at Starbucks. He was like, “What’s going on?” and I told him about the drama and he’s like, “No, what’s really going on?” and then I just kept telling him about other drama and he’s like, “No, I’m not going talk to you unless you tell me what’s REALLY going on.” So I told him all of my deepest darkest secrets, confessed to him in front of a public place at Starbucks. I bawled my eyes out and he cried with me. That was when I felt <i>so</i> light, and he’s like, “Let me teach you how to journal.” So we went to the journal section, he told me to write what happiness means to me, what success means to me and what love means to me. He’s like, “Revise that every month, every day write certain things that triggered you... write why you think so, and write three things you’re grateful for.” I did that every single day, for two years—every single day. It changed my life. I just decided to fully love myself and to take control of my life. Everything before December 17th, 2014 feels like a past life, a completely different person.

<h3 class="question">What is your most terrible memory?</h3>

When I was 19, I was smoking a LOT. I chain smoked cigarettes, like seven cigarettes at a time. (laughs) <i>and</i> I bragged about it, yeah I bragged about it, I thought it was the coolest party trick. So stupid. I did that, ate like shit, partied a lot, never slept, didn’t take care of my body. I went to the doctor for a physical, and they diagnosed me with pre-cancerous cells. I didn’t tell anyone, I didn’t tell my mom, I didn’t tell anybody. I went to get the surgery alone… yeah, that was the darkest time of my life. I thought I was gonna die; this was when I was totally alone. I even showed up to my finance class and I was a wreck. I remember being jealous of other people because they had their health and I’m just like, “What did I do?” I thought I fucked up my life for good. That was a huge dark, time in my life.


<h3 class="question">If you knew that in one year you would die suddenly, would you change anything about the way you are living now?</h3>

I would probably smoke a bunch of DMT and ask about life in general. Just learn more about what else there is to this, and even if I don’t learn about what’s next, I just wanna be able to use this human form to explore as much as I can. That and like, buy everyone ayahuasca trips, for real. (laughs) I’d use all my life savings to buy everyone an ayahuasca trip.

<h3 class="question">What roles do love and affection play in your life?</h3>

Well, one of my love languages is… (laughs) words of affirmation, and physical affection. I really do… I love, LOVE and I love being able to give love unconditionally. What I’ve been working now specifically… I’ve taken a vow of celibacy and to not, you know… for a year. Well I’m not gonna cut myself off from any opportunities, but I just stopped looking for love. I realized that I have a lot of patterns, and issues… not issues but, just like patches that I need to love more. Love more, and be able to love myself.


<h3 class="question">Help me complete this sentence, “I wish I had someone whom with I could share…”</h3>

Ayahuasca trips with! (laughs) Duh!

<h3 class="question">Before meeting you, what is something about you that people should know?</h3>

That I’m completely and utterly candid and I’ll probably talk to you about ayahuasca. Especially when I’m doing your eyebrows and you have no other choice. Also, you should know that I am so candid that sometimes I don’t mean what I say, or I may come off as something, but don’t take it personally cause I’m just being me. I’m very unfiltered, don’t take it personally.

<h3 class="question">What do you like most about yourself?</h3>

My ability to be able to be true, no matter what. Even now, I can’t something that feels wrong to me. I can’t! My values are so strong that I can’t… it just doesn’t feel right. It un-aligns my actions with my values and I can’t.

<h3 class="question">When was the last time you cried in front of another person, when was the last time you cried to yourself?</h3>

I cried in front of my brother. Recently he had just gotten out of a huge lawsuit that has been dragging on for almost four years. It’s completely gone now, it’s over. My mom even mentioned that it feels like we released from house arrest. It wasn’t even his fault though, was him on the suing side. It was just so weird because I'm always used to being the one supporting my family. being the one that can take care of mom. Now that he can help, it doesn’t feel… it just feels so surreal that we never had to deal with this before. We cried together, because we were finally able to be free.

<div class="profile_extra1">
  <img src="{{ page.images }}5.jpg" alt="sexy girl">
</div>

<h3 class="question">What, if anything is too serious to joke about?</h3>

Veganism. (laughs) I’m sorry I keep bringing it up but I’m not sorry. It’s true! The environment really needs to get better, animals are suffering every second, and it’s not a joke. It makes me really upset when people take it lightly cause it’s not a joke.

<h3 class="question">Your house containing everything you own catches fire, after saving your loved ones and pets, you have enough time to make one final dash to save one item, what would that be.</h3>

My melodeon! (laughs)


<h3 class="question">Any last words of general advice?</h3>

Nothing can’t be resolved from surrendering to the flow of the universe. There you go.
